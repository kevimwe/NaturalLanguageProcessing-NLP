1 - Nenokkadine (2014) - IMDb,"Its the same excitement that bring to every tollywood movie guy when they have watched a film in full 'Color' during the times of 'black and white' cinematography. Usually most of the 'Tollywood' films has typically a nice formulae. Start with a fight, a song, chase the villains, two more fights, 10 jokes, fight in climax and END. But This film is completely different. A film that could set standards to the upcoming ones. A completely different road that has been put up this film. And this might be the one of the best films in Tollywood that makes you to be in the script till the end. This not like other movies which defines the laws of the physics. And every other director who are using the usual formulae should see this and try to change the way how it has been taken up by Mr Sukumar. Its awesome. Its a huge leap for tollywood. Excellent cinematography, excellent script (thou it has loosened a bit in the middle) excellent direction, Most stunning background music and good crew. I must also appreciate the Background Music. Mr Devi Sri Prasad has really done an excellent experiment with tuning the same music tone and using it for the different versions. So, when you come out of the theatre, you can still hear the same music. This is awesome. And to understand it you must put your complete concentration on the movie. If some body tells you that this is crap them it means that they haven't seen movies like Dark Knight/Inception/Breaking Bad which give the nostalgia in the end.

"10,000 BC (2008) - IMDb","I'm quite surprised at how many people are slamming this movie for historical inaccuracies, use of English, its similarity to several other films and a happy ending.

"10,000 BC (2008) - IMDb","The film starts by introducing us to a Multi-culti tribe in Switzerland (?) led by a shaman eskimo woman. They seemed to have forgotten that prehistoric hunter gatherers generally wandered around and fill instead their days by waiting all year in their village for mammoths to meander by and kill one for food which luckily lasts all year. Their 'noble' existence is shattered by some Arab horsemen looking for slaves. They leave the Alps into the jungles (!) of Italy(?) where they are attacked by birds which once lived in South America. The scenery changes to Utah as they track the slavers into Africa. They meet some Zulu tribes who happened to have bumped into the Swiss hunter's father and who somehow managed to teach the Zulu tribe the one language that seems to exist in Europe. The Arab desert slavers have attacked the zulus too so the Swiss and the zulus combine forces to attack the slavers. Rather than follow the river (the Nile?) to the slave town, they decide to cross the Sahara (after all there's no food or water by a river so this would seem a sensible option!).After wandering around for weeks they look to the stars and decide to follow the North Star (the slave city, in common with Santa's hideaway is under it apparently). Hey ho, after a few days they find slave city and it turns out to be a pyramid construction site led by an alien. Luckily, the crafty alien god has lots of slaves and a ready source of desert living woolly mammoths to help build his pyramid. Swiss hunter cries 'operation desert freedom' and the slaves rebel. The alien god's Indian eunuchs (fresh out of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom)and some albino africans flee to a giant ship stored in a pyramid but the rebelling slaves catch them up and kill the giant alien who turns out to be 'Lurch' from the Adams family. Eskimo woman then dies back in the Alps to bring Swiss hunters girlfriend back to life in the Sahara (she's prophetic as shes got blue eyes - apparently rare we're led to believe in Switzerland). The film ends with the desert dwelling Zulus giving the Swiss crops which somehow grew in the Sahara. The Swiss then set off home surely cursing that they set Lurch's giant boat alight as it surely would have speeded up their journey across the Mediterranean. They have a group hug back in the Alps when their desert crops begin to grow at the foot of a glacier...Needless to say I won't be buying the DVD",garaidh_200019,March/2008,1," I spy with my little eye....Swiss, Eskimos, Arabs, Egyptians, Indians, Native Americans, Celts, Zulus, Masai, Ethiopians....",0,"[film, start, introduce, us, tribe, switzerland, lead, shaman, eskimo, woman, seem, forgotten, prehistoric, hunter, gatherer, generally, wander, around, fill, instead, day, wait, year, village, mammoth, meander, kill, one, food, luckily, last, year, existence, shatter, arab, horseman, look, slave, leave, alp, jungle, italy, attack, bird, live, south, america, scenery, change, utah, track, slaver, africa, meet, zulu, tribe, happen, bumped, swiss, hunter, father, somehow, manage, teach, zulu, tribe, one, language, seems, exist, europe, arab, desert, slaver, attack, zulu, swiss, zulu, combine, force, attack, slaver, rather, follow, river, nile, slave, town, decide, cross, sahara, food, water, river, would, seem, sensible, option, wander, around, ...]","[the film, starts, by, introducing, us, to, a multi-culti tribe, in, switzerland, led, by, a shaman eskimo woman, they, seemed, to, have forgotten, that, prehistoric hunter gatherers, generally wandered around, fill, instead, their days, by, waiting, all year, in, their village, for, mammoths, to, meander by, kill, for, food, luckily lasts, all year, their, noble, existence, is shattered, by, some arab horsemen, looking, for, slaves, they, leave, the alps, into, the jungles, of, italy, where, they, are attacked, by, birds, once lived, in, south america, the scenery changes, to, utah, as, they, track, the slavers, into, africa, they, meet, some zulu tribes, happened, to, have bumped, into, the swiss hunter, father, somehow managed, to, teach, the zulu, tribe, the one language, seems, to, exist, in, europe, the arab desert slavers, have attacked, zulus, too so, the swiss, the zulus combine forces, to, attack, the slavers, rather, follow, ...]",58.838684785066405,6.425047762483929,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.472049689440993,161,233,film starts introducing us multi culti tribe switzerland led shaman eskimo woman seemed forgotten prehistoric hunter gatherers generally wandered around fill instead days waiting year village mammoths meander kill food luckily lasts year noble existence shattered arab horsemen looking slaves leave alps jungles italy attacked birds lived south america scenery changes utah track slavers africa meet zulu tribes happened bumped swiss hunters father somehow managed teach zulu tribe language seems exist europe arab desert slavers attacked zulus swiss zulus combine forces attack slavers rather follow river nile slave town decide cross sahara food water river would seem sensible option wandering around weeks look stars decide follow north star slave city common santas hideaway apparently hey ho days slave city turns pyramid construction site led alien luckily crafty alien god lots slaves ready source desert living woolly mammoths help build pyramid swiss hunter cries operation desert freedom slaves rebel alien gods indian eunuchs fresh indiana jones temple doom albino africans flee giant ship stored pyramid rebelling slaves catch kill giant alien turns lurch adams family eskimo woman dies alps bring swiss hunters girlfriend life sahara prophetic shes got blue eyes apparently rare led believe switzerland film ends desert dwelling zulus giving swiss crops somehow grew sahara swiss set home surely cursing set lurchs giant boat alight surely would speeded journey across mediterranean group hug alps desert crops begin grow foot glacier needless buying dvd,0.06825396825396826,0.702910052910053,1
13 Assassins (2010) - IMDb,"In 1844, the peace of the Feudal Japan is threatened by the cruel Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira (Gorô Inagaki) that is politically rising and getting closer to his half-brother, the shogun. After the harakiri of Namiya clan leader, the samurai Shinzaemon Shimada (Kôji Yakusho) is summoned by the shogun's adviser Sir Doi (Mikijiro Hira) of the Akash Clan to listen to the tragedy of Makino Uneme ((Takumi Saitô), whose son and daughter-in-law have been murdered by Naritsugu. Then Sir Doi shows a woman with arms, legs and tongue severed by Naritsugu and she writes with her forearm a request to Shinza to slaughter Naritsugu and his samurais.Shinza promises to kill Naritsugu and he gathers eleven other samurais and plots a plan to attack Naritsugu in his trip back to the Akash land. But the cunning samurai Hanbei Kitou (Masachika Ichimura) that is responsible for the security of his master foresees Shinza's intent. Shinza decides to go with his samurais through the mountain, where they find the hunter Koyata (Yûsuke Iseya) that guides them off the mountain and joins the group. Now the thirteen men prepare an ambush to Naritsugu and his army of two hundred samurais in a suicide mission to stop evil. ""Jûsan-nin no shikaku"", a.k.a, ""13 Assassins"", is a future classic of the samurai genre by Takashi Miike. It is inevitable to compare this film with Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurais"" and the epic ""The 300 Spartans"", but ""13 Assassins"" is among the best samurais movies I have ever seen, with a solid story in the Edo period of Japan, stunning cinematography, wonderful performances and fantastic choreography in the battle scenes.

13 Assassins (2010) - IMDb,"The director's stated purpose was to see if ""they"" could make a classic-style samurai movie. He and ""they"" utterly failed. Having seen this garbled junk I would proffer the guess that his real purpose was not to make a movie but to get material to write a how-to book, one that could be titled: ""How to Make a Samurai Movie by and for Idiots."" It's not just the U.S. that is dumbing down, is it? Pity Japan.Three-fourths of the way into the movie I mentally disassociated from it because the endlessly repetitive overkill became boring. Suddenly I could care less about the movie and began to wonder what it would be like going to a restaurant run by Takashi Miike. It would be, perhaps, somewhere in the foothills of western Tokyo. I would arrive at dusk and be welcomed into an old thatched-roof cottage converted into an elegant restaurant. The darkness of the interior would be softly illuminated in places by the warm glow of paper lanterns. Each dish would arrive one by one like scenes in a movie, one after another. First a lacquered bowl of miso soup would arrive at my table, wisps of wakame, a few green slices of scallions, and tiny cubes of tofu would be floating in it. Yum. Delicious. Then would be brought a side dish of thinly sliced lotus root, green soybeans, and hijiki. So far, so good. Then, about halfway through the repast, industrial fluorescent lights would be clicked on overhead, the purpose of which would be to destroy the deeply rich traditional atmosphere. Then, with about as much finesse as his scenes in the movie of ultimately boring, repetitive, endless crowds of slashing that went on and on and on and on. And on and on. And on and on and on and on and on, Miike would toss down a slab of cooked eel right on the bare wood of the table in front of me, not even bothering to use a plate. He would uncap a jar of powdered Japanese sansho pepper and dump the whole jar all over the cooked eel. Looming over me and wielding the bloodied thigh bone of a wild boar he would force me to eat this concoction with my fingers. Me, all along, thinking, like while watching the movie, that good cooks know that a dish of food can be ruined by using too much strong spice. The movie was made unpalatable by that boring, eye-numbing endless crowd slashing scene. Watching these scenes could be likened to trying to eat sushi that is more wasabi than rice or fish, or that eel above that isn't just tastily seasoned with sansho pepper but thickly submerged in it.And that stupid ending. The guy doing a terrible impersonation of Toshiro Mifune's Kikuchiyo in ""Seven Samurai,"" walks up to the only other survivor of the ""total massacre"" showing zero evidence of his having been stabbed through the throat and otherwise slashed by swords deeply. I was thinking perhaps they were both dead until I didn't care. The only meaning that scene had was Miike was messing with the audience. So it's like back at the restaurant, I'm finished; unsatisfied, nauseous, and with an enormous mental bellyache, but ready to pay the bill. Miike says, ""Ha ha. You know that eel you thought you were eating? It wasn't really eel. It was just textured vegetable protein. Ha ha. Fooled you, didn't I?"" Betrayed to the very end. I mentioned idiots above. Whenever I see a movie this bad I look at the hundreds of people listed in the end credits and wonder how so many people can be involved in the making of a movie and not one of them with an ounce of intelligence. Today I got to thinking that movies are often not so much group efforts as mob efforts, and, after all, a mob has the intelligence of the least intelligent member, and the emotional stability of the most psychologically-screwed-up person in the mob. Why was the evil Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira riding a horse when people in his position at that time would be carried in palanquins? Stupid. How did those 13 idiots carry tons of explosives by foot over those mountains they got stupefyingly lost in? They hardly had anything at all they were carrying. Stupid. What was that business with the jerk who had rows and rows of spare swords to swap with the ones he was using? To show him throwing them to amazing effect would be something to see, and an excuse to have a ready supply of them, but, no, he just drops the ones he's using, leaving himself briefly unarmed, just to pick up another sword. Stupid. That huge vat of dark-looking blood spilling from the top of a building that had neither precursory scene nor effect. Stupid. Those 13 jerks who have their quarry trapped like vicious barracuda in a barrel. What do they do? Figuratively get naked and climb into the barrel. Stupid. They didn't have to kill 200 armed warriors, they just had to kill one man. One man who was constantly in the open riding a horse. That they couldn't is just, well, stupid. Takashi Miike and his crew. Stupid. Me for wasting my money on this trash: The most stupid. Downright imbecilic. Thanks for making me feel that way Miike, not.But is it possible that the film makers became so befuddled that this movie, beginning in a super-realistic way, at some point, in a totally confusing fashion, reverted to being something merely symbolic and representational in a ludicrous way?

24 (2016) - IMDb,"Vikram K Kumar is the real hero! All his work in making such a detailed script has payed off. The screenplay will be slightly hard to digest for the commercial movie lovers! But I loved the way he penned the screenplay. The Romantic part is well combined with sci-fi part, so it was very engaging and enjoyable one.Greatest comeback for Surya! If it's Theri for Vijay, it's 24 for Surya! He just basks the whole movie on his back and delivers a great performance! Aathraya role needs special mention as he literally steals the show with his sleek villainous role.! Watch out!ARR silently keeps the flow of the movie with his BGM and you won't get disturbed unlike others. The Art direction and cinematography completes the visual cycle beautifully! Special appreciations to them!Every character is given its own importance.

300 (2006) - IMDb,"This film isn't for all people. That's to say about a lot of movies in general of course, but this one in particular brings up a big clashing point between critics; What do we want to see in our movies? What is more important, to portray a fictional setting for the sake of giving people a mind blowing visual experience or to amuse and amaze them with clever plot twists and intelligent dialogs?First lets analyze what exactly this film is made of. Basically, the whole thing is just one epic fighting scene after another. Most noticeably is the camera work and the visual effects. Every shot seems like it was intended to be a work of art. The colors, the characters, the costumes, the backgrounds... every little detail has been given so much attention. During the big fights you'll also instantly notice the unique editing. There are a lot of ""time slowdowns"" throughout the battles which show what exactly is happening. Fatal wounds that slowly leak blood spatters in the air, decapitated heads traveling in slow-motion across the screen... it's all there. The story on the other hand isn't very complicated, in the sense that the whole movie could probably be described in a sentence or two. The dialogs are simple and most often talk about moral values like freedom and honor. If you would look at the script, it would probably look like another movie that has nothing more to offer then idealistic visions of how life should be.Reviewers of this title seem to be split up in two groups. They either love it with passion calling it an epic movie of the 21th century, or hate it even more and throw it off like a piece of garbage consisting of mindless action and silly cliché phrases. I feel reluctant to take a position in this argument. Normally it's tolerable to weigh out both sides of this matter to result in a fair judgment about a movie. Not in this one. On the one hand the visual are surely among the best to be witnessed in a movie. Every detail, every background, every special effect set to the scenes are so mindblowingly stunning. On the other hand the plot and dialogs are of the most simplistic and quite frankly dumb kind. ""I fight for freedom! I'd rather die in honor then live in shame!"" Sounds familiar? Of course it could be debated that this movie was never intended in the first place to have a unique plot that makes your head spin. But from an objective point of view it's still lacking in this department, so it should be noted.Now that's fine and all, but does that all make of the film? Is it worth watching or what? I think it is. For me the good outweighs the bad by miles. From the second the movie started it grabbed me and didn't let go. Every battle, every scene of the movie had me at the tip of my chair. Everything from the strong acting to the wondrous visuals to the war-shouts of the soldiers was just so stunning... it was truly a wonderful experience.I did not one single moment felt like the movie lacked anything. But I could imagine why other people did.So here's the deal.If you are easily impressed by beautiful landscapes, wonderful camera-work and editing and powerful acting then go see this. Right. Now. You'll be missing out if you don't. There is so much to see, so much power in the way this comic is translated to the big screen... It'll leave you in awe.However, you are looking for a good story, clever plot twists, some innovating to the world of the movies then skip this. 300 contains nothing of this, nor does it wants to give you this. I enjoyed this movie so much, but I know there will be people that will pass of as rubbish, and that's understandable.

300 (2006) - IMDb,"Oh dear god this is bad.As far as I can tell the most significant characters in 300 are the deltoid, bicep, abdominals and the other great muscle groups. It is a testament to how awful this film is that this is somehow a relief. The human cast are entirely secondary to the main aim which is to show lots of people slaughtering lots of other people. The whole thing appears to be some sort of visual love poem to the human body.*may contain spoilers* The plot of 300 can be summed up thusly: ""300 Spartans die"". It's not much of a plot but there you go.King Leonidas (lit. ""maker of chocolates"") is unhappy at the possibility of all the Spartan health-clubs being closed by Xerxes. Having been told that he isn't allowed to defend the Spartan calisthenics program by a bunch of lepers with their own lap-dancer he decided to lead 300 prime Spartan beefcake to the ""hot gates"" for a body building dance-off with the 9 foot tall Xerxes and his army of slaves. Both sides do some flexing before getting down to the fighting. The Persians roll out the most farcical military units they can think of and contrive to get themselves slaughtered very cinematically. A Rhinoceros for #*$@'s sake! A #*$@ing RHINO! Really. A giant, some elephants and a guy with blades for arms who looks as if he should be auditioning for the next Clive Barker movie (who we sadly never see fighting). I was really surprised that there weren't some orcs and maybe a cave troll or two.Finally a hunchback, who looks as if he is a silicon sex toy for the advanced user, sells out the Spartans and shows Xerxes a way round Thermopylae. Then all the Spartans die.Admittedly there seems to be some sort of side plot about some nasty Spartan chappie trying to get the queen into the sack but I assume that this is just a time filler because they couldn't afford to make an entire two hours of CGI fighting.*end spoiler* I would thoroughly recommend that everyone see this film.

3:10 to Yuma (2007) - IMDb,"I saw this film last night at a preview in the lead up to the Toronto International Film Festival. Having never been a big western fan (with a few exceptions - Shane, High Noon, The Wild Bunch) and having been rather indifferent to Walking The Line, James Mangold's last directorial effort, my expectations were modest, despite the hype that the film has received. But I was duly impressed. The action and tension remain constant throughout but, more importantly, the plot is compelling and the acting is terrific. No doubt many will be impressed by Ben Foster's affected performance as Russell Crowe's loyal but psychopathic sidekick (think Johnny Depp in the Pirate movies) but to my taste it was much too over the top in a cast that offered a number of subtle and well thought out performances.Russell Crowe is brilliant as the arrogant, amoral outlaw Ben Wade and Christian Bales infuses his role as a beleaguered rancher and Civil War veteran with just the right mix of pathos and dignity. Iy was wonderful to see Peter Fonda be given a role in which he was allowed to demonstrate his genuine talent, much too long hidden away. In my view, though, it is Logan Lerman who most deserves the accolades that will certainly come his way. He plays Bales' teenage son who comes of age in the course of the film. Initially disillusioned with a father whom he sees as drudge and a failure, he eventually recognizes his father as the hero he is (or at least becomes).Cinematically, this film ranks up there with the best westerns of all time. It is consistently beautiful to watch and captures the expanse and majesty of the American west as well as any movie I've ever seen.In many respects this is a traditional western (it is a remake, after all). They really don't make movies like this much anymore and it will be interesting to see whether it finds an audience in this era of dumbed down teen comedies and quirky slices of dysfunctional modern life.

A Better Tomorrow (1986) - IMDb,"Two brothers (One a cop played by the late Leslie Cheung, the other a thief played by Ti Lung) become enemies after the death of their father while Chow Yun Fat plays a crippled assassin who teams up with Ti Lung to help protect Cheung from the mob boss that is looking to do him in, while at the same time try to redeem himself in the eyes of his police officer brother. A Better Tomorrow is often reported as the best movie John Woo has done and while it is certainly a superior staple on his resume, the movie's tone is a little off and although the movie is very well done the movie gets a tad too melodramatic at times. However that minor flaw aside A Better Tomorrow provides an unusually rich story that details a rocky relationship that seems to never be forgiven. Indeed even at the end, we doubt whether the brothers will ever be as close as they once were.

A Bittersweet Life (2005) - IMDb,"This is one of the best films I've seen in my life, with beautiful cinematography, excellent acting, and most importantly, a great script. It's sad to see that some of you are too busy critiquing the lack of complexity in the plot, because it is this simplicity that makes this movie so beautiful. Since many of you have already reiterated the plot, i'll just cut the chase and try to clear up some confusion, hopefully.First of all, to understand why he let the girl go and turns against his boss, the flashback towards the end is very crucial. When she plays the cello, he smiles, and as he is dying, he smiles as he listens to her voice. These are the only two occasions in which he smiles throughout the entire movie. Whether this is love, attraction, or because he was thankful that she made him feel good, is open to interpretation. Given that he is an extremely straightforward and honest character(and also given that in this movie, everything is what you see on the screen- there are no hidden motives, twists, whatsoever), I assume that the reason he doesn't answer (or CAN'T answer) when asked why he did it by his boss is because he doesn't know himself. I think the key to understanding this movie is the title, and the narration at the end of the movie (something along the line of a disciple telling his master that he cries after a sweet dream because he knows it can't come true). For Sunwoo,the girl and his belief(?) that he can kill everyone else and still live are sweet dreams that cannot come true. The reason why he unrealistically gets by after getting shot and stabbed so much, is not simply because he is the main character, but because everything he does after meeting the girl is like a sweet 'dream', a surreal reality(yes, an oxymoron, just like the title- a 'bittersweet' life). The morbid ending is also very fitting- as sweet as the dream was, the more bitter it is when he ""wakes up"" from it and faces reality(once again relating to the last narration).",sugarbomber8,April/2006,10, My interpretations to clear up some confusion,1,"[one, best, film, see, life, beautiful, cinematography, excellent, act, importantly, great, script, sad, see, busy, critique, lack, complexity, plot, simplicity, make, movie, beautiful, since, many, already, reiterate, plot, cut, chase, try, clear, confusion, understand, let, girl, go, turn, bos, flashback, towards, end, crucial, play, cello, smile, die, smile, listens, voice, two, occasion, smile, throughout, entire, movie, whether, love, attraction, thankful, make, feel, good, open, interpretation, give, extremely, straightforward, honest, character, also, give, movie, everything, see, hidden, motif, twist, whatsoever, assume, reason, answer, answer, ask, bos, know, think, key, understand, movie, title, narration, end, movie, something, along, line, disciple, tell, master, ...]","[is, of, the best films, i have seen, in, my life, with, beautiful cinematography, excellent acting, most importantly, a great script, it, is, sad, to, see, that, some of you, are, too busy critiquing, the lack, of, complexity, in, the plot, because, it, is, this simplicity, makes, this movie, so beautiful, since, many, of, you, have already reiterated, the plot, i, will just cut, the chase, try, to, clear, up, some confusion, hopefully.first, of, to, understand, why, he, let, the girl go, turns, against, his boss, the flashback, towards, the end, is, very crucial, when, she, plays, the cello, he, smiles, as, he, is dying, he, smiles, as, he, listens, to, her voice, these are, only, two occasions, in which, he, smiles, throughout, the entire movie, whether, is love, attraction, because, he, was, thankful, that, she, made, him, feel, good, is, ...]",-38.04738366351761,-0.4367572477832314,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,3,2,0,0,4,4,0,2,0,2,4,2,6.0701754385964914,114,148,best films seen life beautiful cinematography excellent acting importantly great script sad busy critiquing lack complexity plot simplicity makes movie beautiful since many already reiterated plot cut chase clear confusion hopefully first understand let girl turns boss flashback towards end crucial plays cello smiles dying smiles listens voice occasions smiles throughout entire movie whether love attraction thankful made feel good open interpretation given extremely straightforward honest character given movie everything screen hidden motives twists whatsoever assume reason answer answer asked boss know think key understanding movie title narration end movie something along line disciple telling master cries sweet dream knows true sunwoo girl belief kill everyone else still live sweet dreams true reason unrealistically gets getting shot stabbed much simply main character everything meeting girl like sweet dream surreal reality yes oxymoron like title bittersweet life morbid ending fitting sweet dream bitter wakes faces reality relating last narration,0.3128551136363636,0.603125,1

A Sound of Thunder (2005) - IMDb,"What exactly is the sound of thunder? If this movie is any indication then it's the sound of moviegoers thundering towards the exit, demanding their money back. Yes, the movie is that bad.""Hey Johnny, how bad is it?"" This movie is so bad that Ray Bradbury wishes he could invent a time machine so that he could go back in time and NOT write the short story, thus preventing this movie from ever being made.""Whoa, that bad?"" Worse. In fact, this movie is so bad that Ray Bradbury might kill himself just so he can roll over in his grave. I know you think I'm trying to be cute, but I'm being serious. This was one of the strangest movie experiences I've had in quite a while. The problem is that I went into the movie expecting to enjoy it. I thought it had the chance to be pretty good. So at the very start I was trying to make excuses for what was unraveling on screen.The first thing to induce unintentional laughter was the fact that Ben Kingsley (the owner of the time traveling safari who's only interested in how much money he can make) looks like Bob Barker. Nice poofy white wig, Ben. Oh well, no big deal, I can laugh that off. Then we're introduced to the first CGI dinosaur of the movie. ""Hmm, that sure looks really fake,"" I thought. ""Oh, I know! It's supposed to be fake. They're tricking the hunters into thinking the dinosaur is real, but it's mechanical or something."" Nope. Imagine my sheer horror when I came to the realization that the dinosaur was supposed to be real. Wow. At this point I started to get nervous.Then came the incredibly bad green screens. Folks, these are some of the worst green screens I've ever seen. My words cannot do justice to how fake they looked. Some might even say they looked faker than those things Pamela Anderson tries to pass off as breasts. When you can tell that the actors are walking on a treadmill then you have serious issues that are long past addressing. I was absolutely shocked at what I was witnessing. Honestly, I started to get confused and thought, ""What in the world is going on? This movie cost $80 million to make, there's no way it can look this bad."" Where there's a will, there's a way, and somebody must've had a strong will to make this as cheesy and as goofy as they could because I cannot come up with any other explanation.I actually like the concept of the movie - the butterfly effect - the theory that something as small as a butterfly flapping its wings can produce long-term effects on a dynamical system. However, this movie presents the theory in the most outlandish, most unbelievable way imaginable. Sorry, but I just didn't buy it. One of the scientists in the movie argues that if you kill a bee, then that bee can't pollinate a flower, and an animal will not be able to eat that flower, thus that animal will die and can cause damaging long-term effects. Um, if ""Flower A"" never blossoms then an animal that's hungry will just go find ""Flower B"" and eat that. I don't think the animal will immediately die AND CAUSE HUMANS TO TURN INTO ALIEN-LIKE CREATURES!!! Come on.So the movie decides to take the ""butterfly effect"" to the most extreme depths that it possibly can - fine, whatever. What *really* bothered me is it doesn't care to explain why killing the butterfly resulted in the world being taken over by horribly rendered CGI creatures. It would have at least been nice to have an explanation as to why and how such drastic changes took place because of one simple butterfly.The butterfly would've been killed in a volcano that erupts right before they head back to the time machine anyway, so how do you explain that? Well, if your name is A Sound of Thunder then you don't. You just say, ""Here's the premise, now we're just going to become a monster movie and have the good guys be chased by bat monsters in the dark."" Well, I'd be interested in hearing what's said when this movie becomes one of the biggest (if not THE biggest) flops of the year.At about the halfway point I realized that there was no need to continue to rationalize why the movie appeared to be so bad. I accepted the fact that in this case appearances were not deceiving and this was just a really horrible movie. If you can accept that from the start then there is plenty of unintentional laughter to be had.Once our heroes started being chased by weird ape/bat/dinosaur hybrids, I just kicked back, laughed, and shook my head at the fact that the CGI is as bad (if not worse) than what you see in Sci-Fi Original movies starring Lorenzo Lamas and Michael Paré. I wish I were exaggerating.I honestly don't know how this movie was allowed to achieve such mediocrity. You know when one of the characters starts off with an American accent, then begins to fluctuate between American and British accents, and then eventually settles into her native British accent that everybody involved has obviously thrown in the towel and said, ""Screw it, let's just get this over with."" You would think that in the year 2005 a movie with an $80 million budget wouldn't look more like a movie that was made on an $8 million budget. I'm sorry, but CGI this awkward on this size of a budget is just inexcusable. Way to go Hollywood.

Abduction (2011) - IMDb,"Let me open with what any film review should address: I did not enjoy this movie. But first, a disclaimer: despite my reasons, I want to assure you that none of my negative points will verbally lambast lead actor Taylor Lautner just because 'he's some guy from Twilight.' Nor will I make scalding reference to his gratuitous lack of upper body wear; the kind that one would hope comes off as witty commentary but ends up sounding more like an awkward combination of contempt and jealousy. So, with that out of the way, let's get started.When the shy but short-tempered Nathan (Lautner) is paired up with girl next door Karen (Lily Collins) for a school research assignment, he is shocked to find an image of his younger self on a 'missing persons' website, prompting him to question everything he thought was normal about his life. When the cover is blown, he and Karen find themselves on the run, unable to trust anyone in their search for the truth.Not only will I not target any more of this review towards Lautner personally, I will even concede that he does his best on what is otherwise a sinking ship from the opening scene. Naturally, his acting skills do need refinement, and I expect we're not looking at the next De Niro here, but his occasionally lackluster delivery is simply a branch of a much bigger problem- the script.As an unapologetic actioner, it should be expected that Abduction possesses some of the clunky dialogue clichés associated with the genre. These include, but are not limited to 'trust has to be earned', 'I'm not leaving without her' and perennial favourite 'waithow do you know my name?', which is actually used more than once. But among these tired expressions is a handful of headscratchers; lines intended to act as cool quips but possessing an undoubtedly cringe-worthy aftertaste. For example, after Gerry (Sigourney Weaver) helps Nathan escape using balloons to cover security cameras (a la Ocean's Eleven) she releases them with the deadpan, utterly serious line of 'I hate balloons'. So you see my point.The set pieces are just as ludicrous, asking the viewer to buy into the movie too much when we have not been given any reason to engage with the plot in the first place. In one instance, we bear witness to a CIA agent (operating undercover as a suburban housewife) easily take out two trained assassins. The climax set at a baseball game is a storytelling train wreck, fraught with inconsistencies and overly convenient outcomes. At the very least, I hoped a film set in Pittsburgh would show some love for the mighty Steelers instead of the lowly Pirates, but I digress.General flaws in logic and realism are other aspects that can be attributed to this type of movie without having them become a major concern. Often, we tend to overlook moments which would result in serious injury for the hero in real life simply because he's just that, a hero. I'm also willing to pass these moments off, but in Abduction they occur so often, and on such a noticeable scale that they severely detract from any engagement with the film that could be developed as it progresses, and therein lies its greatest letdown.I commend the satisfactory action scenes, which minimised the kind of close-up, rapid camera movement that has drawn the bulk of my ire in recent months. Also, I was pleased to see the film show a bit of gumption by avoiding an entirely happy, alls-well-that-ends-well conclusion, but these upsides are not enough to sweeten what is otherwise an inherently flawed film.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

After Earth (2013) - IMDb,"This film is not recommended.  Father doesn't always know best, the latest result being After Earth, a  vanity project that Will Smith has concocted for his son, Jaden. This  wobbly sci-fi tale of survival will certainly test both Mr. and Mr.  Smith's star power. Director M. Night Shyamalan, the man who  continually keeps falling from grace, one film after the next, is still  tumbling further from his talented beginnings, although here the  director crashes and burns.   This is not to say that After Earth is hopelessly clichéd, it's just  hopeless. Shymalan's well- made film has some striking imagery, mostly  of panoramic vistas, but his ill-conceived screenplay (co-written with  Gary Whitta) keeps this exercise in filmmaking rather earthbound.  Adding to that, his main star and one of the film's producers, Papa  Smith, pushes nepotism to its limits with this unoriginal dreck. (He is  also given story credit for this silliness.) It's not just that this  film has no Will power, it just has too much of it, both on screen and  off.  Will Smith plays the fearless Cypher Raige, a no-nonsense military  commando sent on a mission with his newt of a son, Kitai, played by  Jaden Smith. Cypher is disappointed with his son's lack of achievement  as a cadet and their relationship is a bit strained, just like the  acting. The Smiths obviously look the part and act the part with the  same stilted delivery. Like father, like son. Unfortunately (for us),  they crash land on the apocalyptic Planet Earth. Cypher is injured with  two broken legs, but pain is not an option. However a better script  would have helped matters. Kitai must now go into rescue mode, wearing  his amazing technicolor space suit, fighting beasts and creatures along  the way to becoming a man.   On his journey of self-awareness, Kitai contends with imminent peril:  giant baboons, poisonous leeches, carnivorous tigers, and such. He  needs to deal with the fluctuating below-freezing temperatures and an  active volcano too. Life is hard. Kitai even battles a monster called  the Ursa, a predator that hunts by sensing fear. (If the creature could  instead sense the smorgasbord of bad acting on its plate, the Ursa  would never go hungry again.) The elder Smith underacts and speaks in  annoying solemn platitudes while the younger Smith overacts in a  squeaky nasal voice that only a teenager can tolerate.   The art direction is mind-numbing. The futuristic sets are bargain  basement knockoffs of Disney World's Tomorrowland, circa 1960...very  unimaginative with an overabundance of Rubbermaid-influenced interiors  and enough flowing linen sheets to make one think that Bed, Bath, and  Beyond had given the filmmakers a cut-rate deal for some product  endorsements. All of the special effects are barely adequate and not  the least bit compelling. After Earth has a strange lethargic  listlessness throughout its short length. The film never builds any  real tension or suspense. It's just so dull and unrelenting in its  stupidity.  After Earth is the type of film that gives the sci-fi genre a bad name.  Shyamalan and the Smiths might want to use other aliases after creating  this debacle. Let's hope they refine their own survival skills when  making another film. After Earth is strictly Ursa Minor.   So dear moviegoers, heed the film's tag-line: ""Danger is real, Fear is  a choice"". You have been sufficiently warned about the real dangers in  viewing After Earth...Fear not, it's still in your control.

Aftershock (2012) - IMDb,"Unfortunately this movie looks a lot better in the trailer than it actually is. I'm giving it points for defying expectations but essentially this is a big flop of a movie. The narrative is unconventional to say the least. It spends a staggering 30minutes introducing three serious douchebags. One American, two Chileans. Not explained how they came to be roving around Chile, but they have money and not a lot of responsibility. You would imagine that after thirty minutes these guys are going to be the major characters. Surprise! Only one of these guys survives any distance into the disaster and during the latter half of the movie the main characters are three girls who are considerably less fleshed out than the guys we met first off.That's not the only narrative flaw. Why is there such an effort made to introduce the girl with the wu-tang tattoo. Is she going to feature in the rest of the film? Nope. Are any of the character backgrounds actually important to the story or how they act under pressure? Not really. How come during the cable car crash (whatever it is) a crowded street suddenly becomes utterly deserted?

In the film there is suspense , comedy , emotion , action-packed , tongue-in-cheek and chases galore with impressive velocity pursuits . The screenplay is nicely developed as well as characters and the frenetic action united to excellent special effects that are varied of these too . From the beginning until the end the amusement and entertainment is continued . The humor moments are in charge of Frankie Muniz with his abundant botches and goofs that happen when he must confront perils and risks against the villains . It's a spoof of James Bond's films , even there's a flying artifact like in ¨Thunderball¨ , plus a role type ¨Q¨ , a weapons deliverer , who teaches the various gadgets which Cody Banks will subsequently use . Exciting final facing off between the protagonists and the baddies on the mountain headquarter is breathtaking and special mention to the habitual villain Arnold Vosloo (The mummy) , he is terrific. Colorful cinematography by Denis Crossan ; the exterior of the CIA headquarters was shot on location in the Academic Quadrangle at Simon Fraser University near Vancouver , this location is popular for films shot in this city .

Agent Cody Banks (2003) - IMDb,"Taking advantage of a couple of hot teen television properties at the time, MGM fashioned this fantasy for kids about a typical teenage boy with one big secret. Agent Cody Banks is a CIA operative, part of a special program that trains kids for special missions. And in the title role Frankie Muniz gets to do them, providing he's not grounded.The other hot property at the time was Hilary Duff who was in Disney's Lizzie McGuire series while Muniz was doing Malcolm In The Middle. She's Frankie's assignment, Duff is the daughter of a scientist who's gone missing and Frankie has to both protect her and find out what's going on.It's something big all right, scientist Martin Donovan has invented some kind of artificial life that will eat anything carbon or silicon based. That could wreak a lot of havoc in the wrong hands. Donovan is Duff's father, as for Muniz's parents they are unbelievably clueless, but that's part of the charm of these films. One who's not clueless is Muniz's immediate superior and handler Angie Harmon. She's got a great scene in the prep school where Muniz has been put to be close to Duff with some of the adolescent males there. Agent Cody Banks with the star power of two current teen idols made a lot of money, so much so a sequel was made.

Alex Cross (2012) - IMDb,"If you think you might like this movie from the trailer...go see it and ignore the bad reviews...its a good movie. If this is the worse movie you seen - you haven't seen very much. As for being predictable - easy to say that- and there aren't many movies out there thats not a bit predictable. The acting was OK, yes it really was - some of the lines they had to deliver weren't the best, but that isn't the actors fault.

Alex Cross (2012) - IMDb,"It's not hard to figure out what's wrong with this movie. Skeptics may think Tyler Perry was a bad choice to fill in a young Morgan Freeman's shoes but he was absolutely fine in the role. Plus, Matthew Fox as a psychopathic skinhead assassin? Hell yes. Edward Burns as Perry's detective partner? Eh, less convincing but I'll let it slide. The direction and the writing though... whew. It's amazing the actors were able to recite this dialogue with a straight face.The story of Alex Cross is a simple murder mystery - Alex Cross and his partner investigate the scene of a crime and discover that they're after a professional killer referred to as Picasso. Then things get personal and Cross plans to seek his revenge once and for all. Standard crime thriller plot, right? The problem is when the characters start talking to each other. Honestly, it's laughable how bad some of this dialogue is, especially between Cross and his family. They throw in these ""emotional"" scenes to break up the action but all they do is make for a really awkward paced movie. It would be passable if the dialogue actually moved the plot forward but it doesn't, at all. There are some subplots that are introduced and never brought up again. Like Alex Cross becoming an FBI agent. What was the point of even including that?The main reason to watch this movie is for Matthew Fox. He's playing a sadist who is ""fascinated by pain."" Not very original but who cares, it's Matthew Fox playing a 130 pound untamable psychopath. The scenes in which we see him doing his job - stalking his targets, infiltrating their houses, taking out their body guards and whatnot - are the most interesting parts of the movie. He's really the only character given a clear cut motive and enough development to make him a decent antagonist. He's also batsh*t crazy, did I mention that? Yeah, he's a lot of fun to watch.Unfortunately Perry isn't given nearly as much to work with. He's a generic detective masquerading under the name Alex Cross who acts as a poor man's Sherlock Holmes. His whole objective is to get into the mind of this madman while trying to maintain a steady family life, but instead of building tension between these two factors and having them play off one another and ultimately effecting Cross' personal life, the writer/director think it's more effective to jump from one setting to another with no lead-ins or relevance to what just happened or what is about to happen. The family scenes are cringeworthy, and even the dialogue with his partner gets really cheesy. I wanted to see more psychological warfare between Cross and Picasso. They try to do that in a couple scenes but it's so poorly written that you don't believe a word of it.Tyler Perry's acting shines in a few scenes. He's certainly a capable dramatic actor and anyone who says otherwise is talking out of their ass. Thankfully I haven't seen the Madea movies so I had no prior opinion of Perry but he won me over with this. Mind you, some of his lines sound forced and awkward but that's completely on the scriptwriters. It's just impossible to be drawn to the character, and you'd think with a title like Alex Cross that we'd get a deep look into the mind of the title character, but instead they spoon-feed us this cheesy soapy dialogue and the occasional battle-of-wits with the villain that isn't the least bit intriguing. Also, the climax of this movie, if you can even call it that, is laughable. The fight scene is probably the worst camera work I have seen in an action movie. You can hardly see what's going on half the time, and once it ends you're just like, okay. Is that it?Again, the leads save this movie from being a total bomb. I was admittedly entertained for a good portion of the movie despite its stupid dialogue. None of it is inventive or new; it's just your run-of-the-mill murder mystery that is low on thrills and high on cheese. Worth a one time watch if it's on TV or something, but really the main thing you'll remember from Alex Cross is the criminally wasted talent.",lnvicta8,May/2015,3, Convincing performances by Perry and Fox prevent Alex Cross from being completely unwatchable.,0,"[hard, figure, wrong, movie, skeptic, may, think, tyler, perry, bad, choice, fill, young, morgan, freeman, shoe, absolutely, fine, role, plus, matthew, fox, psychopathic, skinhead, assassin, hell, yes, edward, burn, perry, detective, partner, eh, less, convincing, let, slide, direction, write, though, whew, amaze, actor, able, recite, dialogue, straight, story, alex, cross, simple, murder, mystery, alex, cross, partner, investigate, scene, crime, discover, professional, killer, refer, picasso, thing, get, personal, cross, plan, seek, revenge, standard, crime, thriller, plot, right, problem, character, start, talk, honestly, laughable, bad, dialogue, especially, cross, family, throw, emotional, scene, break, action, make, really, awkward, pace, movie, would, passable, dialogue, ...]","[it, is, not hard, to, figure, out, is, wrong, with, this movie, skeptics, may think tyler, perry, was, a bad choice, to, fill, in, a young morgan freeman, shoes but he, was, absolutely fine, in, the role, matthew fox, as, a psychopathic skinhead assassin, hell, edward burns, as, perry, detective partner, less, convincing, i, will let, it, slide, the direction, the writing, though, whew, it, is amazing, the actors, were, able, to, recite, this dialogue, with, a straight face.the story, of alex cross is, a simple murder mystery, alex cross, his partner investigate, the scene, of, a crime, discover, that, they, are, after, a professional killer, referred, to as, picasso, then things, get, personal, cross, plans, to, seek, his revenge, once, for, standard crime thriller plot, right, the problem, is, when, the characters, start talking, to, each other, honestly, it, is, laughable, how, bad, some of, this dialogue, is, especially, cross, his family, they, ...]",208.15632384276591,-8.719770132784403,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,3,1,1,4,1,3,1,0,1,2,0,5.87843137254902,255,350,hard figure wrong movie skeptics may think tyler perry bad choice fill young morgan freemans shoes absolutely fine role plus matthew fox psychopathic skinhead assassin hell yes edward burns perrys detective partner eh less convincing let slide direction writing though whew amazing actors able recite dialogue straight face story alex cross simple murder mystery alex cross partner investigate scene crime discover professional killer referred picasso things personal cross plans seek revenge standard crime thriller plot right problem characters start talking honestly laughable bad dialogue especially cross family throw emotional scenes break action really awkward paced movie would passable dialogue actually moved plot forward subplots introduced never brought like alex cross becoming fbi agent point even including main reason watch movie matthew fox playing sadist fascinated pain original cares matthew fox playing 130 pound untamable psychopath scenes job stalking targets infiltrating houses taking body guards whatnot interesting parts movie really character given clear cut motive enough development decent antagonist batsh crazy mention yeah lot fun watch unfortunately perry given nearly much work generic detective masquerading name alex cross acts poor mans sherlock holmes whole objective mind madman trying maintain steady family life instead building tension factors play another ultimately effecting cross personal life writer director think effective jump setting another lead ins relevance happened happen family scenes cringeworthy even dialogue partner gets really cheesy wanted psychological warfare cross picasso couple scenes poorly written believe word tyler perrys acting shines scenes certainly capable dramatic actor anyone says otherwise talking ass thankfully seen madea movies prior opinion perry mind lines sound forced awkward completely scriptwriters impossible drawn character would think title like alex cross would deep look mind title character instead spoon feed us cheesy soapy dialogue occasional battle wits villain least bit intriguing climax movie even call laughable fight scene probably worst camera work seen action movie hardly going half time ends like okay leads save movie total bomb admittedly entertained good portion movie despite stupid dialogue none inventive new run mill murder mystery low thrills high cheese worth time watch tv something really main thing remember alex cross criminally wasted talent,-0.021741135848278692,0.44528653885796743,0
Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker (2006) - IMDb,"I was at the World premiere in London and I was apprehensive about watching a film adaptation of a book as some of them work and others don't. This one definitely does. From the first minutes of the film, you know that you're in for a thrilling adventure. Alex Rider, played superbly by Alex Pettyfer, is very believable as a school kid thrown into the deep end by Bill Nighy who hams it up brilliantly as spymaster Alan Blunt. Alex Rider is a deadly weapon on two legs as you'll see as the film progresses. Marvellous Micky Rourke, plays the evil villain who keeps a very unusual and deadly pet and looks as if he's just stepped off the set of a Revlon ad (you'll see!!). There's lots of action, some love interest, but that's not overplayed and although some of the evil characters look as if they've been loaned out from Cirque Du Soleil, including Micky Rourke, they play their parts as they should be, comically but with a twist of evil thrown in. It all works very well but Alex Pettyfer is a revelation. He plays the part coolly, calmly and with a great deal of conviction. I think Sean Connery would be proud of him. The film throws in a few James Bondesque clichés and there is one scene in the film which will remind you of a particular person from Goldfinger !! All in all highly enjoyable, my 11 year old niece and 14 year old nephew and their friends really enjoyed it and I think you will too.",lyndon_gray18,July/2006,9, Action packed fun for older children and adults,1,"[world, premiere, london, apprehensive, watch, film, adaptation, book, work, others, one, definitely, first, minute, film, know, thrill, adventure, alex, rider, played, superbly, alex, pettyfer, believable, school, kid, thrown, deep, end, bill, nighy, ham, brilliantly, spymaster, alan, blunt, alex, rider, deadly, weapon, two, leg, see, film, progress, marvellous, micky, rourke, play, evil, villain, keep, unusual, deadly, pet, look, step, set, revlon, ad, see, lot, action, love, interest, overplayed, although, evil, character, look, loan, cirque, du, soleil, include, micky, rourke, play, part, comically, twist, evil, thrown, work, well, alex, pettyfer, revelation, play, part, coolly, calmly, great, deal, conviction, think, sean, connery, would, ...]","[i, was, at, the world premiere, in, london and i, was, apprehensive, about, watching, a film adaptation, of, a book, as, some of them, work, others, do, not, definitely does, from, the first minutes, of, the film, you, know, that, you, are, in for, a thrilling adventure, alex rider, played, superbly, by, alex pettyfer, is, very believable, as, a school kid, thrown, into, the deep end, by, bill, nighy, hams, it, up, brilliantly, as, spymaster alan blunt, alex rider, is, a deadly weapon, on, two legs, as, you, will see, as, the film progresses, marvellous micky rourke, plays, the evil villain, keeps, very unusual and, deadly pet, looks, as if, he, is just stepped, off, the set, of, a revlon ad, you, will see, is, lots, of, action, some love interest, is not overplayed, although, some of, the evil characters, look, as if, they, have been loaned, out from, cirque du soleil, including, micky rourke, they, play, their parts, as, they, ...]",-68.02284892190454,-2.0094474920040537,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,3,2,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,5,5.848484848484849,99,122,world premiere london apprehensive watching film adaptation book work others definitely first minutes film know thrilling adventure alex rider played superbly alex pettyfer believable school kid thrown deep end bill nighy hams brilliantly spymaster alan blunt alex rider deadly weapon legs film progresses marvellous micky rourke plays evil villain keeps unusual deadly pet looks stepped set revlon ad lots action love interest overplayed although evil characters look loaned cirque du soleil including micky rourke play parts comically twist evil thrown works well alex pettyfer revelation plays part coolly calmly great deal conviction think sean connery would proud film throws james bondesque clichés scene film remind particular person goldfinger highly enjoyable 11 year old niece 14 year old nephew friends really enjoyed think,0.1712121212121212,0.6598484848484847,1
Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker (2006) - IMDb,"I was so excited about this film. I absolutely love the books, and although the trailer of the movie implied a few silly changes had been made, I still thought it would be true to the heart of the book.What a travesty. From the moment it began I knew that being a fan of the book was not a good idea. Alex Pettyfer is not Alex Rider. Since when was Alex Rider actually particularly good at being a spy. In the film, he's already far better than any spies MI6 have to offer before he goes to training. HE'S MEANT TO BE RELUCTANT. The training camp is supposed to be a huge task for him, but apparently falling off a zip wire to music by the Gorillaz is a tough training programme. The characters became gimmicky and ridiculous, they were like cartoon caricatures. Jack Starbright is not some kung-foo, puffer-fish loving idiot that she is in the film. Alicia Silverstone is wooden and irritating. Alex Pettyfer spends the entire duration of the film content with the fact he looks good, and doesn't feel the need to really look upset or happy or anything when these kind of emotions are required. He basically sat back, had a few facial shots of him looking moody filmed, and let his stunt double do the rest. Smithers - Stephen Fry what are you doing?? He was sarcastic and moody, he's meant to be practically the only jolly person Alex meets. And MISSI PYLE MAY JUST BE THE MOST IRRITATING ACTRESS EVER. WHAT WAS SHE DOING?!? If at any time the film started to redeem itself, she'd come on stage and run into something and say something in her ridiculous accent (By the way, that entire sequence with Jack and her made me want to walk out). Everything was wrong. All the suspenseful moments from the book - Alex swimming under water in the mine, the jellyfish scene, the quad bike scene (which wasn't even in the film, and is one of the best scenes in the book), EVERYTHING, was just rushed and ruined, and linked together with bad one-liners such as, ""what is this, Hogwarts?""Utter, utter farce.

Aliens (1986) - IMDb,"Aliens (1986) is the best Epic Sci-Fi Classic Action Movie of all time and one of my personal favorite best action sci-fi flicks that I love to death. Just like I love The Terminator and T2, I love this movie to death. James Cameron's classic masterpiece. The now classic science fiction film was only the third feature directed by James Cameron (following Piranha Part Two, The Terminator). It is the sequel to the 1979 film Alien and Alien is a masterpiece I love that film, but I love this movie more sorry this is my personal opinion this is my movie. I am not saying it is better than the original movie but it is right up there with Alien a real classic.  Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the sole survivor from the original ""Alien"", returns to Earth after drifting trough space in hyper sleep for 57 years. Although her story about the Alien encounter is met with skepticism, she agrees to accompany a team of high-tech marines back to LV-426 and this time it's war! It has great cast I love the marines fighting aliens in this movie. The movie stars: Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, William Hope, Jenette Goldstein, Al Matthews, Mark Rolston , Ricco Ross, Colette Hiller, Daniel Kash ,Cynthia Dale Scott and Tip Tipping and they are all believable enough.I love the characters beside Ellen Ripley, Newt, Corporal Hicks, Bishop, Private Hudson, Private Vasquez, Sergeant Apone, Private Drake, Private Frost, Corporal Ferro, Private Spunkmeyer, Corporal Dietrich, Private Crowe I love those platoon of US Colonial Marines I know I haven't mentioned Burke because he was the bad guy and I don't like him. But most of the characters in this movie I love.  I know it is a sci-fi action film but it also does a have a horror mixed together people just don't see that. There's plenty of horror in it. The nightmare sequence in the beginning, the creepy atmosphere of the LV-426 colony, and the heart pounding face hugger on the loose scene in the medical bay. You see mother of those aliens who cocooned all the humans and killed them you see Ripley finding the nest and fight the Alien queen on the end. Ripley faces her fear and gets over her PTSD by going in by herself to rescue the Girl/Fight the Aliens/and Destroy the Entire Nest...Battles One on One with an Alien Queen and Whips its' Ass...and, by the end, now both her and Newt can dream without the worry of any more Nightmares (which plagued Ripley at the beginning of the film).This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $100 million budget (in 1986!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores from James Horner of stuntmen used.10/10 I have the Blu-ray disc which it also have a special edition version on it I used to had this film on DVD but I throw it away because I bought the Blu-ray which I am very happy about it.

Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007) - IMDb,"I didn't read any reviews of AvPR before going to see it, as I feel they skew the experience, but afterward I read several to see how the movie was received, and I'm disappointed at the number of people who are bagging this movie, when simply compared to previous Alien titles.I loved the original Alien movies, 1 & 2 especially, not so much 4 and I disliked 3, and while AvP1 wasn't a smash hit, it had the elements and hallmarks present that made the original Predator and Alien movies a hit, and the same can be said for AvPR.The movie is slanted toward horror and gore, rather then the suspense that made the originals so unique, and while thats not my cup of tea, I did enjoy the action and thrill of the movie that was there.When you compare AvPR to the original Alien or Predator movies, I agree that it in no way stacks up, but thats comparing it to the best in the business. The originals were ground breaking, unique and hit a much more innocent audience, these days you need to do *ALOT* to stun an audience, and I think that's why these additions are being so poorly received.AvPR for me was like the movie Doom, had little to nothing to do with it's roots, which is aggrivating, but expected, and yet despite that was still entertaining from a purely action/horror movie standing point. This was a decent Horror flic with great CGI and several plot twists, was it a credit to the Alien or Predator franchise, no - but you'd want to make one hell of a movie these days to compare to a classic of that caliber.",G_Train20,April/2008,6," Not Great, But Not As Bad As Most People Say.",1,"[read, review, avpr, go, see, feel, skew, experience, afterward, read, several, see, movie, receive, disappoint, number, people, bagging, movie, simply, compare, previous, alien, love, original, alien, movie, especially, much, disliked, smash, hit, element, hallmark, present, make, original, predator, alien, movie, hit, say, movie, slant, toward, horror, gore, rather, suspense, make, original, unique, cup, tea, enjoy, action, thrill, movie, compare, avpr, original, alien, predator, movie, agree, way, stack, compare, best, business, original, ground, break, unique, hit, much, innocent, audience, day, need, stun, audience, think, addition, poorly, like, movie, doom, little, nothing, root, aggrivating, expect, yet, despite, still, entertain, purely, movie, stand, ...]","[i, did not read, any reviews, of, avpr, before, going, to, see, it, as, i feel they, skew, the experience, afterward i read, several, to, see, how, the movie, was received, i, am disappointed, at, the number, of, people, are bagging, this movie, when, simply compared, to, previous, alien titles.i, loved, the original alien movies, especially, not so much, 4 and i, disliked, while, was, not, a smash, hit, it, had, the elements, hallmarks, present, that, made, the original predator, alien, movies, hit, the same, can be said, for, avpr.the movie, is slanted, toward, horror, gore, rather then, the suspense, that, made, the originals, so unique, while, is, not, my cup, of, tea, i, did enjoy, the action, thrill, of, the movie, was, there.when you, compare avpr, to, the original alien, predator movies, i agree, that, it, in, no way stacks, up, is comparing, it, to, best, in, the business, ...]",-61.5188142139699,8.176470584485896,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,0,2,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,5,5.47872340425532,94,133,read reviews avpr going feel skew experience afterward read several movie received disappointed number people bagging movie simply compared previous alien titles loved original alien movies 1 2 especially much 4 disliked 3 avp1 smash hit elements hallmarks present made original predator alien movies hit said avpr movie slanted toward horror gore rather suspense made originals unique thats cup tea enjoy action thrill movie compare avpr original alien predator movies agree way stacks thats comparing best business originals ground breaking unique hit much innocent audience days need alot stun audience think additions poorly received avpr like movie doom little nothing roots aggrivating expected yet despite still entertaining purely action horror movie standing point decent horror flic great cgi several plot twists credit alien predator franchise would want hell movie days compare classic caliber,0.10847222222222223,0.5385714285714285,1
Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007) - IMDb,"From what I understand, Fox was embarrassed they released a PG-13 Alien/Predator movie not so long ago. It was not well received by any means.Not exactly sure where to go next, seeing as they thought Anderson was the best director for the franchise and they had produced a true sci-fi gem, Fox turned to it's small, but knowledgeable group of monkeys for answers.These monkeys were by no means veterans of writing sci-fi flicks, but had seen Burton's Planet of the Apes remake and House of the Dead. Their first task: hire actors. Fox gave them a reasonable budget but the monkeys wanted to save the money. They hired fifteen TV actors shortly after.Now, the script. The monkeys wanted to save more of the budget so they wrote the movie themselves. Leaving out important aspects of the two franchises was the easy part. Thinking of great new lines for the general audience to remember years down the line - that was more difficult. They butted heads awhile and came up with a truly award-winning screenplay equipped with cliché characters, idiotic decisions an gaping plot holes.Fox was pleased thus far with the results but wanted to see what was to become of the centerpieces to the film - the aliens and predators. The monkeys again wanted to save money in the budget so they decided to trash the great robotics used in the otherwise terrible AvP original and go with the man-in-the-suit Alien seen in the old films. The actors playing the aliens had trouble fitting into the suits as they weren't properly sized by the monkeys so they jiggled their plastic heads throughout the film with honor. As for the predators, the monkeys decided one predator was enough this time around (again, saving budget) to fight the hordes of aliens that seemingly come out of nowhere. But what about the effects, you ask? Come on now, people. They may be monkeys but they clearly knew CGI would play a key role in the film. Without diving into the budget, the monkeys used a standard Final Cut program and cut and pasted some very nice fire and spark effects throughout. Putting red and green filters over the camera lens provided some excellent Predator visions.The setting was something the monkeys thought long and hard about. If this was to be on Earth, in Colorado of all places, they needed to make it realistic. This was where they admitted they might have made a mistake. See, the monkeys didn't have proper training in this department so they thought turning the lights off in the city and having the movie play out in the dead of night and in the rain was the right thing to do. They simply forgot people like to see the creatures instead of looking at shadows and rain the whole film. To add insult to injury, the monkeys accidentally filmed all the fight scenes incredibly close so no one could see what was fighting or who it was. But again, rookie mistake.The rating. Fox told the monkeys to make the movie R-rated. That was easy. Without showing how many of the injuries or deaths actually happened, the monkeys made a habit of showing the carnage after the fact. It was simple: the viewers got the gore they desired and the monkeys didn't have to film the majority of action shots involving that violence.Some of the actors originally had questions concerning the screenplay. Why does a blue liquid the Predator has endless amounts of magically disintegrate whatever he wants it to and nothing more than that? Why is an ex-convict driving around in a police car the entire movie? Why did the monkeys forget to show a full body shot of the Aliens? Why does a clock play a more memorable role than any of the main characters? The list of questions just kept growing but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece. Fox was thrilled with their work. So thrilled that they opened the movie nationwide on Christmas Day and even spent a few bucks advertising it the week before it came out. The monkeys had successfully made another installment in these cherished franchises.But some ask, what ever happened to the budget the monkeys forgot to use? They put it towards their next film: Aliens vs. Predator vs. Hulk Hogan. They knew the general public would be upset with the title but they have since released this statement:""To the people- do not worry about our upcoming film. It will be rated R and will have violence.""And everyone lived happily ever after.

Alita: Battle Angel (2019) - IMDb,"I'll be honest, when I went into to cinema to watch this movie I was expecting to not like it. I had seen a little bit of the trailer and it did not really ""speak"" to me and Alita's eyes were off putting. When the movie had begun I was actually searching for things to dislike but surprisingly there were none apart from a few cringeworthy moments. I quickly got used to Alita's eyes and they became in fact likeable. The story began to draw me in and I got completely absorbed into the story and the visuals.The world is extraordinary and beautiful and the action scenes in this movie are fantastic, quite honestly some of the best I have seen. The story is a bit fast paced but not to a degree that it feels rushed. Alita as a character is great, she is kind-hearted, innocent, naive and protective. Throughout the movie Alita grows as a person and learns about sacrifice, loss, love and the horrors of the human mind. Alita is very likeable because she is such a good person in such a horrible world and you can't help feeling very sympathetic for an innocent being like her as she is exposed to the cruel world of Iron City.I watched this movie without knowing the source material and I loved it.

Anaconda (1997) - IMDb,"Now, I am a snake lover.  I love snakes of all kinds, even when they are in my house.  It pains me to kill them or see them killed.  And when I heard this movie would be out, I thought ""Uh oh.""  But I watched it anyway. Please beat me.  Allow me to point out everything that went wrong with this tripe.  And these are spoilers, by the way.1)  Anacondas have never gotten any bigger than 40 feet on record.  How big was this one?2)  An anaconda is a very muscular predator.  It can kill a crocodile by SUFFOCATION NOT BONE CRUSHING.  Any snake, as a matter of fact, does not have the power to crush bones or pop veins.  They just don't.  They just suffocate their prey by compressing their lungs and windpipe.3)  Although they are very stong, it is impossible for the snake to pick up a human being, lift it up, and swallow it upright.  They can't.  It has to do with physics and biology.4)  It takes a snake a very long time to swallow its dinner.  It can take up to an hour for it to swallow a crocodile.  And that means that it would take nearly 3/4 of an hour to swallow these people.  If it felt compelled to go after them, first of all.5)  A SNAKE IS NOT A FISH.  It cannot stay under water for that long, and it does not go after the smell of blood.  A snake hunts by sight and the smell of the animal.  They made this snake out to be a shark.  And even if they did go after blood, that monkey was dead.  They go after movement.6)  A snake will vomit its food if it feels threatened.  It serves a confusion tactic for enemies.  Did this snake feel threatened?  No.  And when they do vomit, it does not fly out like that guy did.7)  Do you know how long it takes a snake to digest a meal?  When a python eats a boar, it goes without food for almost a year.  That means that that anaconda would be pretty well-fed after the first victim.8)  An anaconda does not kill for the fun of it.  They leave that to humans.9)  An anaconda will not let go of its current prey, which is still alive, and go after something dead.

Anniyan (2005) - IMDb,"Shankar and Vikram have done a fantastic job. Director Shankar is turning into a professional high-quality perfectionist. Actor Vikram, charged with a National award for Best Actor (2004) is on a roll. His performance is classy and comparable to many great actors of Tamil cinema.Anniyan is definitely worth watching at least once. Forget about the critics who list past movies from which various aspects of Anniyan (like concept, theme, stunts, music) was inspired (or copied). It is easier to make the original than to make a copy as the original serves as a hard benchmark. It is hard to replicate something while maintaining audience interest. Shankar does this job to a more-than-satisfying extent.Besides, when great directors like Steven Spielberg copy past movies (War of the worlds) with the confidence of providing the viewers something worthwhile to watch, I don't see anything wrong in Shankar's Anniyan. Yet, Anniyan is NOT a complete copy and it is definitely MORE than the sum of its parts.Anniyan has stunts that were never before seen in any Tamil movie. Shankar has provided the opportunity to the (uneducated mass of) Tamil audience of watching world-class stunts in a movie that they can understand (as against most Hollywood flicks that have the action but make no sense to them). So what, if it has been copied? Matrix Reloaded being largely mystifying and unexplained, even to most native-English speakers, could not justify to the (masses of the) Tamil audience as to why all the action exists!!??. But that is not the case with Anniyan.To sum it all up, Anniyan is what a movie should really be. A classy entertainer. Good songs, great cinematography, wonderful (although sometimes unbelievable) stunts, great acting performance, nice comedy and classic direction.

Anniyan (2005) - IMDb,"What a terrible disappointment this movie was. Shankar was pathetic in trying to churn out a mediocre entertainer to fill his pocket rather than go with the type of new and graphically controvertial ideas that come into mind which make his movies so exclusive. Heres where Anniyan fails,Plot - Essentially a repeat of Indian and Mudhalvan and not as good as either by far. This time around, the people get blamed for their behavior in society. When you think about it, it did a little bit of potential and the movie could have been a bit more violent and used some better ideas devoid of clichés. All the familiar stories show up.Acting - The worst ever. The bad deeds done by society are all unconvincing, look intentional for the camera and are done by too many familiar actors who you simply can't picture playing such roles. Vikram's acting is highly overrated and utterly stupid as that Remo character. In all of Shankar's movies, the acting was super realistic to the extent that it shocked you. Not here. It was lame. Prakash Raj just plays himself and is an unconvincing police officer.Action - Horrid, comical style fight scenes with a 3rd rate repeat of matrix and kill bill fight scenes with 1/50th the budget. The stunt and camera guys really ripped Shankar off.Comedy - Very good. Vivek keeps the movie going. Some other characters also deliver good comedy. Songs - No AR Rehman. Nuff said.Special effects - Why do stupid 3D Graphics and CGI done by the worst ever teams keep showing up? They have no point whatsoever. They are embarrassing. Did Shankar really think that the audience was dumb enough to buy that Anniyan 3D animated an entire world using only Macromedia Flash?If you look at Boys, you can see that Shankar really wanted to make his movies as graphic and realistic as possible.

Arjun Reddy (2017) - IMDb,"It has been a refreshing experience watching this movie. The romance, characterization is at its raw best. I am glad that the director and his team did not do anything to dial it down. The performances have been great. We all know the story, but it has not been done before in Telugu cinema. In some ways, this can be called modern Devdas with realistic dialogue.Without spoiling; the story is about a young MBBS student with anger management issues falling in love. Arjun Reddy's character is deeply flawed. I must appreciate the director and crew steering away from the Telugu movie way of showing the lead character in a perfect light. I am glad the character is flawed. There are several instances in this 186 minute movie that shows us the flawed side of our hero. It works out for the story telling. Also in this tale, we see characters yelling swear words when under stress or anger; which does not happen in other flicks.The physical romance couldn't be more appropriate. It's is present where necessary and only promotes story telling and emotions. Also, the story is also about a bunch of characters constantly caring and supporting Arjun Reddy despite his strong requirement for sole confinement. The sick kick friend is more than a side kick shows real spine in tense moments, also providing subtle comedy in the various situations. The movie does not commit to one message. The grandma says ""a person who wants to suffer must be left alone and that person will soon get back on his feet""; But almost all characters related to the hero (Brother, friends) always keep visiting Arjun despite Arjun yelling them to go away. It was the supporting friends and family that bring back a almost lost soul back. When Arjun loses everything, left with no money and thrown on the road; it's the brother and father who spend their money to send Arjun to exotic countries to help him get over the girl.The movie doesn't seem 3 hour long, but definitely feels lengthy, often straining the eyes. Preethi's character is underdeveloped, but she did a decent job at that. The heroin side track was unnecessary and does not contribute much.Overall, this is a refreshing change in Tollywood and I can see a lot of directors experimenting by not following the Telugu formulaic trend in the upcoming years.",seshasai-tris29,August/2017,8, May be the first modern cult classic in telugu,1,"[refresh, experience, watch, movie, romance, characterization, raw, best, glad, director, team, anything, dial, performance, great, know, story, do, telugu, cinema, way, call, modern, devdas, realistic, spoil, story, young, mbbs, student, anger, management, issue, fall, love, arjun, reddy, character, deeply, flaw, must, appreciate, director, crew, steer, away, telugu, movie, way, show, lead, character, perfect, light, glad, character, flaw, several, instance, minute, movie, show, u, flaw, side, hero, work, story, tell, also, tale, see, character, yell, swear, word, stress, anger, happen, physical, romance, could, appropriate, present, necessary, promotes, story, tell, emotion, also, story, also, bunch, character, constantly, care, support, arjun, reddy, despite, ...]","[it, has been, a refreshing experience, watching, this movie, the romance, characterization, is, at, its, raw best, i, am, glad, that, the director, his team, did not do, anything, to, dial, it, down, the performances, have been, great, we, know, the story, it, has not been done, before in, telugu cinema, in, some ways, can be called, modern devdas, with, realistic dialogue.without spoiling, the story, is, about, a young mbbs, student, with, anger management issues, falling, in, love, arjun reddy, character, is, deeply flawed, i, must appreciate, the director, crew steering, away, from, the telugu movie way, of, showing, the lead character, in, a perfect light, i, am glad, the character, is, flawed, are, several instances, in, this 186 minute movie, shows, us the flawed side, of, our hero, it, works, out for, the story, telling, also, in, this tale, we, see, characters, yelling swear, words, when, under, stress or anger, does not happen, in, other flicks.the physical romance, could not be, more appropriate, it, ...]",34.01392389034789,-4.923224754465877,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,5.859872611464968,157,206,refreshing experience watching movie romance characterization raw best glad director team anything dial performances great know story done telugu cinema ways called modern devdas realistic dialogue without spoiling story young mbbs student anger management issues falling love arjun reddys character deeply flawed must appreciate director crew steering away telugu movie way showing lead character perfect light glad character flawed several instances 186 minute movie shows us flawed side hero works story telling tale characters yelling swear words stress anger happen flicks physical romance could appropriate present necessary promotes story telling emotions story bunch characters constantly caring supporting arjun reddy despite strong requirement sole confinement sick kick friend side kick shows real spine tense moments providing subtle comedy various situations movie commit message grandma says person wants suffer must left alone person soon feet almost characters related hero brother friends always keep visiting arjun despite arjun yelling away supporting friends family bring almost lost soul arjun loses everything left money thrown road brother father spend money send arjun exotic countries help girl movie seem 3 hour long definitely feels lengthy often straining eyes preethis character underdeveloped decent job heroin side track unnecessary contribute much overall refreshing change tollywood lot directors experimenting following telugu formulaic trend upcoming years,0.07402054467271857,0.4571348940914159,1

Athadu (2005) - IMDb,"With his innocent looks, everyone thought that he could not play professional killer to good extent. But, Mahesh proved his critics wrong once again in this action drama. Though movie started as a pure action oriented, it slowly goes towards family drama. With few hiccups which are quite natural in mainstream cinema, Athadu is a must watch for Mahesh' performance, good music and lavish production values. Kudos to Mahesh.

Athadu (2005) - IMDb,"The fact that I am not an Indian and don't live in India is something you should consider when you read my review. I do lover Indian films and have seen a couple hundred...but I am definitely an outsider. ""Athadu"" is a film I enjoyed during the first half of the movie. But as the film progressed, my interest waned greatly. And the CGI- intensive ending really, really annoyed me.The film begins with a sweet little kid, Nandu, murdering some gangster type. Obviously this is NOT an ordinary little psychopath. Soon a guy sees the kid's psychotic promise and gets him to become a contract killer. The credits appear and then suddenly the boy has grown to be a studly man. He is now a super-assassin. In fact he's so good that he's approached with a bizarre proposition...he's to deliberately make an unsuccessful attempt on a politician's life. They explain that the injury will guarantee the guy an easy win in the election. However, when Nandu is setting up and readying for his shot with a rifle and scope, someone else shoots and kills one of the folk!! Almost instantly, the police KNOW where Nandu is and try to catch him...he's obviously a patsy for someone's evil plot.After evading the police, he finds himself in a train with a talkative man named Pardhu. It seems that Pardhu has been estranged from his small town family for over a decade and now he's finally returning. However, after conveniently telling Nardu EVERYTHING about himself, Pardhu is killed by police fire as shots ring out. Nardu escapes again and makes himself to the town where Pardhu was headed...with the intention of him assuming Pardu's life and identity. This is a nice setup and I liked this portion of the movie. But when the super-clichéd lady love interest is introduced, the quality and style of the movie changes. It had been an exciting and gritty crime film...but now a sappy and ridiculous romance. She turns out to be the most spoiled, obnoxious and self-absorbed woman I have EVER seen in a movie...and, inexplicably, you know that faux Pardhu will fall for her. This makes no sense...and having him KILL her would have made much, much more sense. What also doesn't make a lot of sense is seeing a serial killer slowly changing into a swell guy who comes to love his new family!While all this is bad, it gets MUCH worse at the end with a giant shootout with many baddies and faux Pardhu taking them all one and, naturally, winning. This is bad enough but so much of this is done in slow-motion, with crazy ridiculous CGI. It is so over-stylized and dumb that I found myself praying for the movie to end!!!The bottom line is that I know you will a few clichés in Indian movies...they are so often formulaic. But the awfulness of the woman took it from formula to the ridiculous...and the ending was hellishly bad. It's a shame....it really DID start off very well.",MartinHafer16,March/2017,3," By the end of the movie, the film totally lost me and I gave up...",0,"[fact, indian, live, india, something, consider, read, review, lover, indian, film, see, couple, hundred, definitely, outsider, athadu, film, enjoy, first, half, movie, film, progress, interest, wan, greatly, intensive, end, really, really, annoyed, film, begin, sweet, little, kid, nandu, murder, gangster, type, obviously, ordinary, little, psychopath, soon, guy, see, kid, psychotic, promise, get, become, contract, killer, credit, appear, suddenly, boy, grown, studly, man, fact, good, approach, bizarre, proposition, deliberately, make, unsuccessful, attempt, politician, life, explain, injury, guarantee, guy, easy, win, election, however, nandu, set, ready, shot, rifle, scope, someone, else, shoot, kill, one, folk, almost, instantly, police, know, nandu, try, catch, ...]","[the fact, that, i, am, not, an indian, do not live, in, india, is something, you, should consider, when, you, read, my review, i, do lover, indian films, have seen, a couple, hundred...but i, am, definitely, an outsider, athadu, is, a film i, enjoyed, during, the first half, of, the movie, as, the film, progressed, my interest, waned, greatly, the cgi, intensive ending, really, really annoyed, me.the film, begins, with, a sweet little kid, nandu, murdering, some gangster type, obviously, is, not, an ordinary little psychopath, soon, a guy, sees, the kid, psychotic promise, gets, him, to, become, a contract killer, the credits, appear, then suddenly, the boy, has grown, to, be, a studly man, he, is, now, a super-assassin, in, fact he, is, so good, that, he, is approached, with, a bizarre proposition...he, is, to, deliberately make, an unsuccessful attempt, on, a politician, life, they, explain, that, the injury, will guarantee, guy, an easy win, in, ...]",83.98754056169469,-1.0970101275264956,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,3,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.83425414364641,181,250,fact indian live india something consider read review lover indian films seen couple hundred definitely outsider athadu film enjoyed first half movie film progressed interest waned greatly cgi intensive ending really really annoyed film begins sweet little kid nandu murdering gangster type obviously ordinary little psychopath soon guy sees kids psychotic promise gets become contract killer credits appear suddenly boy grown studly man super assassin fact good approached bizarre proposition deliberately unsuccessful attempt politicians life explain injury guarantee guy easy win election however nandu setting readying shot rifle scope someone else shoots kills folk almost instantly police know nandu catch obviously patsy someones evil plot evading police finds train talkative man named pardhu seems pardhu estranged small town family decade finally returning however conveniently telling nardu everything pardhu killed police fire shots ring nardu escapes makes town pardhu headed intention assuming pardus life identity nice setup liked portion movie super clichéd lady love interest introduced quality style movie changes exciting gritty crime film sappy ridiculous romance turns spoiled obnoxious self absorbed woman ever seen movie inexplicably know faux pardhu fall makes sense kill would made much much sense lot sense seeing serial killer slowly changing swell guy comes love new family bad gets much worse end giant shootout many baddies faux pardhu taking naturally winning bad enough much done slow motion crazy ridiculous cgi stylized dumb found praying movie end bottom line know clichés indian movies often formulaic awfulness woman took formula ridiculous ending hellishly bad shame really start well,0.0142652944539737,0.6167524299599771,1
Attack on Titan: Part 1 (2015) - IMDb,"As a non-fan I was mildly entertained. Didn't think it was terrible, didn't think it was the best film ever. I felt it faithfully translated a very convoluted TV series the best way it could within 90 mins while not sacrificing action and Titan screen time.I don't consider myself a fan of the TV series, but being someone in their late 30's who grew up on they heyday of Japanese animation back in the 80's and 90's--Attack on Titan was the first time in a long while that an animation from there felt fresh, poignant and emotionally compromising for the viewer. The young kid in me would have loved this TV series, but the late 30's me who has been through a lot in life and chooses to seek out more positive and cheerful entertainment felt it got a bit too overly depressing and macabre. That's not saying I felt it was bad, just no longer my taste in entertainment anymore.Fanboys/fan-girls on here rating this film 1's have noticeably a lot of impractical whines concerning the film. They simply are expecting a 600 hour TV animation series to be summed up in 90mins. It doesn't take someone who has worked on a film to realize that is setting up an impractical expectation. Characters and situations ARE to be expectedly retooled in order to give the film proper pacing. Sure, some characters in the film that fans had invested a lot of hours into via the TV series are sometimes sidelined, rewritten or killed off. I expected and knew this would happen and it didn't change my perspective on the overall film because I didn't go in with impractical fan expectations of this ""film adaptation"". Of course a 600 hour TV series has plenty of time for you to become emotionally invested with meat shield fighters that the overall story had every intention of killing off down the line for more emotional impact. But trying to delve into all those characters in a 90 minute film isn't going to happen. Have to be more objective than that within the context of this adaptation.That being said the film does suffer from being disjointed and rushing through major plot points towards the final cliffhanger. It's really a film that just gets to the point and does not bores you with exposition that you can pretty much obviously figure out on your own.The Titans are absolutely as terrifying as I remembered from the TV series and faithfully depicted. I found myself covering my face in some parts like I did with the TV series, so I think they did their job well in translating the horror and macabre of what the humans went through.The action was obviously CGI heavy, but not done in a way that felt tawdry. They perfectly captured the aerial flight and feel of the fights from the TV series well.Attack on Titan was by no means a 1 rated film. It's no Ed Wood film. It's no Manos the Hands of Fate. It's not Glitter levels of bad. It's not a film that is really that terrible. It's a film that on a baseline captures the terrifying essence of the TV series main concepts, but does suffers a little bit on core characters development.",tcampbell7622,August/2015,6, It's not as bad as the fan-boys on here are saying...,1,"[mildly, entertain, think, terrible, think, best, film, ever, felt, faithfully, translate, convolute, tv, series, best, way, could, within, min, sacrifice, action, titan, screen, consider, fan, tv, series, someone, late, grow, heyday, japanese, animation, back, attack, titan, first, time, long, animation, felt, fresh, poignant, emotionally, compromise, viewer, young, kid, would, love, tv, series, late, lot, life, chooses, seek, positive, cheerful, entertainment, felt, get, bit, overly, depress, macabre, say, felt, bad, longer, taste, entertainment, rating, film, noticeably, lot, impractical, whine, concern, film, simply, expect, hour, tv, animation, series, sum, take, someone, work, film, realize, set, impractical, expectation, character, situation, expectedly, retool, order, ...]","[as, a non-fan i, was mildly entertained, did not think, it, was, terrible, did not think, it, was, the best film, ever, i, felt, it, faithfully translated, a very convoluted tv, series, the best way it, could, within, 90 mins, while, not sacrificing, action and titan screen, time.i do, not consider, myself a fan, of, the tv series, being, someone, in, their, late, grew, up on, they, heyday, of, japanese animation, back, in, s--attack, on, titan, was, the first time, in, long, while that, an animation, from, felt, fresh, poignant, emotionally compromising, for, the viewer, the young kid, in, me, would have loved, this tv series, late, me, has been, through, a lot, in, life, chooses, to, seek, out, more positive and, cheerful entertainment, felt, it, got, a bit, too overly depressing and macabre, is not saying, i, felt, it, was, bad, just, no, longer, my taste, in, entertainment anymore.fanboys/fan-girls, on, here, rating, this film, have, noticeably, ...]",100.26286374749094,14.236519787974874,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,1,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.7740112994350286,177,272,non fan mildly entertained think terrible think best film ever felt faithfully translated convoluted tv series best way could within 90 mins sacrificing action titan screen time consider fan tv series someone late 30s grew heyday japanese animation 80s 90s attack titan first time long animation felt fresh poignant emotionally compromising viewer young kid would loved tv series late 30s lot life chooses seek positive cheerful entertainment felt got bit overly depressing macabre saying felt bad longer taste entertainment anymore fanboys fan girls rating film 1s noticeably lot impractical whines concerning film simply expecting 600 hour tv animation series summed 90mins take someone worked film realize setting impractical expectation characters situations expectedly retooled order give film proper pacing sure characters film fans invested lot hours via tv series sometimes sidelined rewritten killed expected knew would happen change perspective overall film impractical fan expectations film adaptation course 600 hour tv series plenty time become emotionally invested meat shield fighters overall story every intention killing line emotional impact trying delve characters 90 minute film going happen objective within context adaptation said film suffer disjointed rushing major plot points towards final cliffhanger really film gets point bores exposition pretty much obviously figure titans absolutely terrifying remembered tv series faithfully depicted found covering face parts like tv series think job well translating horror macabre humans went action obviously cgi heavy done way felt tawdry perfectly captured aerial flight feel fights tv series well attack titan means 1 rated film ed wood film manos hands fate glitter levels bad film really terrible film baseline captures terrifying essence tv series main concepts suffers little bit core characters development,-0.02929841897233201,0.5248149193801368,0
Attack on Titan: Part 1 (2015) - IMDb,"A few minutes into the movie I was taken by surprise that the director chose to wildly mash up the characters and their relationships.

Avatar (2009) - IMDb,"Let me preface this by saying I am a huge James Cameron fan. I think ""Terminator"" is a masterpiece of sci-fi and the single best edited film of all time, ""Aliens"" is easily the best sequel not from the original director and I personally like it a lot more than the original. ""Abyss"" created an interesting world and was racked with tension, ""Terminator 2"" is an action tour-de-force and has what I believe the best sound editing/design of all time, ""True Lies"" is goofy fun, more poignant than most give it credit for with a boffo ending, and finally ""Titanic"" was far better than anyone expected it to be and has one of the most believable romances in a movie.So then there was the 12 year wait for ""Avatar"". No reviews, word of mouth, ticket price or natural disaster would keep me from the midnight IMAX 3D screening. I went with moderate expectations, which the film matched exactly. While this kept me from being disappointed it wasn't a good thing.Movie fans were on edge because if ""Avatar"" flops, it'll mean the death of creativity in a remake-happy Hollywood. That's a valid concern but the problem is nothing in ""Avatar"" is creative whatsoever. It is literally ""Dances with Wolves"" in space, right down to having a ""Wind in his Hair"" character as a foil to the ""new guy"".As the movie progressed it caused the worst of all bad reactions for me as a viewer - I started thinking about other things. Then I kept thinking ""well the end battle is supposed to be awesome"".SPOILER WARNING! (if for some reason you can't guess how this movie ends) End battle comes and the movie switches from being ""Dances with Wolves"" to Disney's ""Atlantis"" (but that's unfair since both of those movies contained far, FAR better musical scores) Gunship windows that were impervious to arrows a few scenes ago (to show Na'vi desperation) suddenly become brittle and break easily (to show Na'vi heroism). The battle isn't nearly as long as you'd expect, and nowhere near as epic / engaging as the finale of Return of the King. Finally there's a Robo-suit vs Navi fight and it is admittedly pretty good. Unlike 95% of directors these days Cameron knows enough to pull the camera back and let us SEE the fight. However it's an odd choice to spend millions on 10 foot tall ""creatures"" and then rarely even have them in the same frame as humans.And of course there's the obligatory scene where characters are dying in slow motion as Middle Eastern vocal music plays (see Gladiator or Munich) Wouldn't have been so bad if I hadn't said to my friend on the way there ""How much you wanna bet there's a part where characters die in slow motion over Middle Eastern music?""As with most movies these days ""Avatar"" is far too long, glossing over important details (why is Earth dying, what does Unobtainium do, etc) and instead spending time on flight scenes, mystic ceremonies, spirit trees and nature bonding.Ultimately I just did not care. Since the dawn of cinema Hollywood recycles old ideas every few decades and slaps on a bigger budget / new stars / better effects so you won't notice. I can see re-doing ""Ben Hur"" with color and sound, but why do we need ""Dances with Wolves"" with 20 times the budget and blue Native Americans? No amount of impressive visuals, robo-suits, gunship battles, perfect character CGI or Sigorney Weaver can change the fact that I've seen this movie 100 times before. I could even accept the weak story if there were any characters to give a rat's ass about. This film is also dreadfully humorless, a stark contrast to ""Titanic"" where humor was one of its many surprises.Regarding 3D... I've seen many films in it now and honestly you don't even notice after the few minutes. It doesn't make the money any better or worse, just more expensive.Citizen Kane, The Robe, Sound of Music, Jaws, Star Wars, Batman, Toy Story, The Matrix... these movies changed movies. We can say that looking back now. ""Avatar"" saying it would ahead of time is pure hubris, ""unsinkable Titanic""-like poppycock.But if expensive motion-capture being used to cover up a weak, generic story is the future of cinema then count me out, I'll stick with my PS3.",benjamin-heckendorn20,December/2009,6, How could anyone who's seen more than 4 movies in their life find this creative?,1,"[let, preface, say, huge, james, cameron, fan, think, terminator, masterpiece, single, best, edit, film, time, alien, easily, best, sequel, original, director, personally, like, lot, original, abyss, create, interest, world, rack, tension, terminator, action, believe, best, sound, time, true, lie, goofy, fun, poignant, give, credit, boffo, end, finally, titanic, far, better, anyone, expect, one, believable, romance, year, wait, avatar, review, word, mouth, ticket, price, natural, disaster, would, keep, midnight, imax, screen, go, moderate, expectation, film, match, exactly, kept, disappointed, good, fan, edge, avatar, flop, mean, death, creativity, hollywood, valid, concern, problem, nothing, avatar, creative, whatsoever, literally, dance, wolf, space, right, wind, ...]","[let, me, preface, this by, saying, i, am, a huge james, cameron fan, i, think, terminator, is, a masterpiece, of, sci-fi, single, best edited, film, of, all time, aliens, is, easily, the best sequel, not, from, the original director, i, personally, like, it a lot, more, than, the original, abyss, created, an interesting world, was racked, with, tension, terminator, is, an action, tour-de-force, has, i, believe, the best sound editing/design, of, all time, true, lies, is, goofy fun, more poignant, than most give, it, credit, for with, a boffo, ending, finally, titanic, was, far better, than, anyone, expected, it, to, be, has, of, the most believable romances, in, then, was, the 12 year wait, for, avatar, no reviews, word, of, mouth, ticket price or natural disaster, would keep, me, from, the midnight imax, 3d screening, i, went, with, moderate expectations, which the film, matched, exactly, while, kept, ...]",266.92952450385246,-11.100296497307221,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,1,2,1,4,2,3,1,0,1,2,0,5.484429065743946,289,398,let preface saying huge james cameron fan think terminator masterpiece sci fi single best edited film time aliens easily best sequel original director personally like lot original abyss created interesting world racked tension terminator 2 action tour de force believe best sound editing design time true lies goofy fun poignant give credit boffo ending finally titanic far better anyone expected believable romances movie 12 year wait avatar reviews word mouth ticket price natural disaster would keep midnight imax 3d screening went moderate expectations film matched exactly kept disappointed good thing movie fans edge avatar flops mean death creativity remake happy hollywood valid concern problem nothing avatar creative whatsoever literally dances wolves space right wind hair character foil new guy movie progressed caused worst bad reactions viewer started thinking things kept thinking well end battle supposed awesome spoiler warning reason guess movie ends end battle comes movie switches dances wolves disneys atlantis unfair since movies contained far far better musical scores gunship windows impervious arrows scenes ago show navi desperation suddenly become brittle break easily show navi heroism battle nearly long would expect nowhere near epic engaging finale return king finally robo suit vs navi fight admittedly pretty good unlike 95 directors days cameron knows enough pull camera let us fight however odd choice spend millions 10 foot tall creatures rarely even frame humans course obligatory scene characters dying slow motion middle eastern vocal music plays gladiator munich would bad said friend way much wan na bet part characters die slow motion middle eastern music movies days avatar far long glossing important details earth dying unobtainium etc instead spending time flight scenes mystic ceremonies spirit trees nature bonding ultimately care since dawn cinema hollywood recycles old ideas every decades slaps bigger budget new stars better effects notice ben hur color sound need dances wolves 20 times budget blue native americans amount impressive visuals robo suits gunship battles perfect character cgi sigorney weaver change fact seen movie 100 times could even accept weak story characters give rats ass film dreadfully humorless stark contrast titanic humor many surprises regarding 3d seen many films honestly even notice minutes money better worse expensive citizen kane robe sound music jaws star wars batman toy story matrix movies changed movies looking avatar saying would ahead time pure hubris unsinkable titanic like poppycock expensive motion capture used cover weak generic story future cinema count stick ps3,0.1440417514212695,0.5787741876597299,1

Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017) - IMDb,"Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover. People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry. When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years. Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra. 1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen.

It was pure cartoonish n bad movie. Was not keen on watching the 2nd but sometimes u cant deny ur pals. The only reason i am writing a review of this trash is to let my anger out. The story of this movie was so lame that at times i felt m i watching an 80s bollywood crap. The hero is shown as the best human being without any shades of grey. Basically there was zero effort in the screenplay. Lets come to the acting. Inspite of the movie being 3 hrs long, there is zero character development. The lead actor, Prabhas was pathetic. The expressions n mannerisms were not convincing. The editing was the worst. Most of us started fiddling with our fones. Ther r unnecessary scenes which jus drags on. Cinematography in this movie was awful. The direction is very amateurish. The director didn't know how to create tension or get the best outta his cast n crew. Coming to the vfx of this movie, i found it to be cartoonish n very silly. The scene where Baahubali uses coconut trees as an infiltrating object for his army to get on top of the fort would be remembered as the most unintentional comedic scene. Some of the video games n animated movies r much better than this trash. So many arrows are fired yet Bahubali gets away easily. The dam scene man.Regarding originality n creativity: Straight away copied from 300, Game of thrones, Superman vs Batman, Ong bak, Hercules, Troy, The Mummy, Wonder woman.

Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) - IMDb,"I was eagerly waiting for this film and I was not disappointed.Baahubali is one of the most visually impressive films that have come from India. Everything about this film is good - Story, direction, beautiful cinematography, haunting score and amazing visuals (though they lack some details at some places). I didn't know who Rajamouli was, basically because I am from North India and I don't follow south Indian cinema. But I am sure he is someone you should know about. SS Rajamouli is amazing. He has made something that we can be proud of. I was sure that the VFX would be good however I had a doubt about the story. Rajamouli proved me wrong with this film. The story and the execution is really good. Story takes elements from Indian mythologies (specially from the life of Lord Krishna) . You can not expect more. He took a big risk and made it big. This is what we need, good quality cinema. Salman fans should learn something from it. All the actors are good and perform their part really well(except Tamanna. She tries too hard but fails miserably). In fact, Tamanna has been used as a plot device (A MacGuffin as Alfred Hitchcock used to call it). Prabhas is okay in the beginning but transforms into a behemoth during the second half. This guy is a natural. He doesn't act exceptionaly but his presence is enough to give you the feels.The background score needs special mention because it is amazing. It is different from anything you have ever heard in India. The score that plays during war is haunting. (Clearly inspired from the LotR) I would be lying if I didn't say that Rajamouli spent a lot of time watching The Lord of The Rings. Yes, some scenes will remind you of 300 and the Lord of The Rings but believe me it is completely different. He doesn't copy anything, he uses it as a source of inspiration. There is only one scene that I remember from LotR which has been used in Baahubali. But denying that he was influenced by Peter Jackson would be a big lie. Its a great thing that he was influenced by such a great film otherwise we wouldn't have Baahubali.The quality of graphics work is very good. In fact its insane for such a cheap price given that Hollywood uses big budget for the same. The battle sequence is SPECTACULAR and reminded me of Battle of Helm's Deep and Pelennor fields from LotR.But the movie is not without some minor problems. There are unnecessary songs which ruin the experience (I laughed so hard when Prabhas started dancing randomly. Everyone was looking at me.) and some parts are dragged (specially the first half) . Also there are continuity problems and some actors are over-the-top. Cut down the songs and edit the movie and voilà we will have a SPECTACULAR film.Baahubali is not the answer to 300, Gladiator or The Lord of The Rings because saying so would be foolish. Don't compare this movie to the Hollywood ones because we still have a long way to go. It's not the Indian 300, its Indian ""Baahubali"".So in the end, I would like to say - Go and watch it instead of watching the crap that Bollywood has been producing lately. Its something to be proud of. Book your tickets and watch this Indian grand spectacle. You wont regret it.

Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) - IMDb,"I was fascinated by the rave reviews for the two Baahubali movies so I decided to give them both a try. (Any movie scoring 8 or above on IMDb has a solid chance of being a winner.)What I have learned is that IMDb scoring is subject to the social media phenomenon of being skewed by an ardent fan base. In the case of Baahubali, the movie has been a huge hit in an isolated market, continental India. A billion Indians can't be wrong, but they sure can skew an IMDb rating when they vote as a bloc.While Baahubali is astounding audiences in its native homeland (there are some great articles about the movie's importance to the industry and to the North and South regions of the country), American audiences with their highly sophisticated expectations will most likely agree with me that the overall result is an immature, incredibly predictable, poorly executed, soap opera that does not merit its hype or its two-part 5 and half hour running time.MY OBSERVATIONS: Baahubali's story is intriguing as it presents to us a legendary super hero who appears to come from a rich and ancient history/lore. The source material is every bit as promising as heroes from Western culture (Samson, Superman, Hercules, etc.). However, the execution of the story turns great drama (love, family, betrayal, support from the gods, fall from grace) into a soap opera complete with cheesy reaction shots accompanied by shock music more appropriate for 1970s TV sitcoms with their spit takes and laugh tracks.The highly applauded visual effects are mediocre by American standards. Other reviewers have detailed these issues adequately so I will only add my support to their criticisms.The acting is hit or miss. Some scenes come across powerfully (love scenes, for example) while others (like those in the royal court) remind us of American TV sitcoms from the 1970s.BOTTOM LINE: If you are calibrated to fine cinema, are looking for a good epic, and are considering Baahubali, then do some research and enter into the viewing prepared to walk away.

Baby (2015) - IMDb,"Though I don't categorize movies on the basis of their region or country, I had mentioned this title regarding India being proud of this movie. This is because I have heard people yelling in social media and in public about the low standards of Indian movies specially thrillers which either lack thrill or are copied from Hollywood. I agree to them o most occasions but this one. And I would strongly recommend people who complain about the lack of good movies in Bollywood to go and watch it. Or else stop complaining these craps.Coming on to the movie, it describes the biggest agenda world is facing right now, i.e, Terrorism, in best way it could. The story comprises of many small incidents which are bound together so slickly that we feel the smooth flow of script. We are lost in the hustle going on in front of us and are keen to know what is coming next. First half makes the plot for the movie and the second half unleashes the execution. Each and every scenes complements its predecessor and we are biting our nails without even noticing it. Last hour is full of thrilling actions and grueling proceedings.Talking about the acting , I must say Akshay Kumar has delivered a role of his life very convincingly. He lives his character and puts that extra amount of thrill via his superb action. Danny plays his role quite brilliantly. Anupam, Tapsee, Kay Kay and other supporting casts act life to their characters and make this movie a combo of power packed performances.Director Neeraj Pandey has already made a Wednesday and Sp 26 in past and thats why there was a very little scope for improvement for him. But I would be lying if i don't say that this is a notch higher that his earlier masterpieces. Editing is quite crisp. Screenplay is the soul of this movie while BM is equally engaging. Cinematography is grand and deserve applause. Dialogues are apt and support the movie a lot. Music is average and rightly so. Choreography is nil while action is breathtaking.It has a few flaws here and there in a few scenes but those are hardly noticed due to the fast paced drama and screenplay.Overall, a standing ovation for Neeraj and Akshay to give us Indians a movie to feel proud of.

Baby Driver (2017) - IMDb,"I love this action movie! The story negatively expresses the goodness and genuineness of a man. Audiences are quite impressed with Baby's goodness which showed through series of mistakes during his taking driver role in bank robbery business. Crime is a form of business. 
Doc is a business agent for bank robbery who hired by unknown social forces who seek illegal benefits by exploiting thugs. Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor and he also did great job for this role. His acting is sensitive for expressing humanism via dark side of human race. Doc is not a completely brutal guy for Baby even when Baby recorded every conversation among thugs and make it into musics. 
Socially disabled Baby's encounter with waitress Debora is everyone's dream! Debora and bank victims who saved by Baby testify his goodness at the court in the last sequence. Then, Baby has happy ending after released from jail. Audiences accepted the happy ending!

Baby Driver (2017) - IMDb,"This movie had a lot of potential. It started out great, but it began to fall apart rapidly just after the halfway mark.

Disappointing. It ends up being just a variation of ""The Last Ride"" (2004).

Then Buddy shows up again later after getting shot in the chest. Superhuman villains in a non-superhero movie tend to ruin the whole thing.Doc remaining in the place from where the heist was launched at risk of being caught for no reason (even though he knew it was botched) made no sense, just like his sudden change of heart in ""helping"" Baby made no sense.Oh and Jon Bernthal is only in the movie for about 10 minutes, so not sure why he was given top billing, when he's pretty much just an extra with a couple of lines.

Bad Girls (1994) - IMDb,Best expression of women in westerns I have seen so far. This eclipses the Sharon Stone film The Quick and the Dead. The latter film softens the lead character by making her survival depend wholly on the Russel Crowe character. In Bad Girls Madeline Stowe eats up the dust on the west and shows a no nonsense gunslinger that has been rare since the Man With No Name hit his stride with a trilogy of spaghetti westerns that made Clint Eastwood a universal star. I can hardly ignore the great cinema style and the substance of this movie that transcends the gender of it's hero. Make no mistake about it this is Stowe's movie to win or lose and she comes away having broke the bank at Monte Carlo. See it with open eyes if you like westerns.

Bad Girls (1994) - IMDb,"Jonathan Kaplan's Bad Girls leaves an interesting taste in my mouth. It is an energetic and fun film, offset by its ridiculous characters and plot. The believability factor in this flick is low, which encourages its audience to view it as a swirling maelstrom of metaphor and symbol. Woman, as defined by the early 90's, can overcome any impediment and still be beautiful, no need to become manly (and lose her femininity) to assert herself. The Western genre serves as a perfect tableau for this discourse because it is one traditionally dominated by men. Likewise, the men in Bad Girls each represent an institution of American culture that is dominated by men and their mentality, conveniently dispatched by the bad girls.Four whores raise hell by killing a Colonel and running out of town, complete with unnecessary slow motion of Drew Barrymore shouting ""heeyah!"" and the humiliation of every man who crosses their path. The military, traditional justice, and Christianity are trampled upon, left wondering how these motivated and hard working women could escape their clutches. The film from here takes some twists and turns, and several complete circles. In short, the whores chase a dream of establishing a home for themselves around a mill that Mary Stuart Masterson's late husbands owned, countering the murderous advances of men with their own sexual flaunting. Gunfights, smarmy dialogue, pseudo-lesbianic encounters, and female flesh fill the film to to a near bursting capacity, much like Barrymore's bosom.It is not what I would call a smart film, however it does present itself as an interesting fable about the empowerment of women by women who remain women. I would liken Bad Girls to that of the Freudian dreams of those who struggle against ""the man.""

Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015) - IMDb,"Despite being a Salman fan I was not too impressed with some of his recent flicks which in my humble opinion lacked freshness or had mindless direction, so when a family member bought tickets for this movie I didn't go in with high expectations. But to you dear reader I'll say GO WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS! It will not disappoint! And more importantly go with your heart - that is all you need for this 2.5 hours long film to become one of the best you've seen in years. It's just one of those movies with such heart-tugging moments and the highlight - the bond between Pawan (Salman) and Shahida (Harshali) - which is such a delight to see that you forget all about plot, logic, direction - not to say that the movie lacks that. The perfection in execution is definitely there, especially in the second-half. I watched it in the AVX theatre with at least 500 others and from the sound of it at least 75% of them regardless of age or gender were crying from the intermission onwards - sometimes because it was sad and other times because the screenplay was just so pure and unfiltered that it just made these happy tears bubble up inside of you.There is a certain level of comedy throughout and definitely some deep witty one-liners. My favourite was from Nawazuddin Sidduiqi (who played his role to perfection) who pointing at the current state of the media and their polarization of India and Pakistan proclaimed that ""Hatred sells. Mohabbat doesn't."" The movie has depth, a message, and the cuteness overload that is Harshali Malhotra.

Batman Begins (2005) - IMDb,"It sickened me in the past to see the Batman movie franchise slowly digging it's way to an early grave. After the quality Tim Burton films, the series pretty much went down the toilet, beginning a horrifically campy age of 'Bat credit-cards' and an armored Arnold Schwarzenegger tossing cringe-worthy puns at a Batman who seemed to be trying not to be embarrassed by the fact that his costume had nipples. So what could Warner Brothers producers hope to do to resurrect the franchise? Pretend it never happened, and start the whole series over again with a talented director, compelling story and capable cast. Enter Christopher Nolan, the mastermind behind 2000's 'Momento', widely praised as one of the most innovative films of the decade. As director/co- screenwriter, Nolan creates a richly dark, atmospheric world for Batman to inhabit, similar to that of the Burton films, but less cartoony. The film's screenplay, written by Nolan and David S. Goyer is quality stuff, it's true that some of the dialog exchanges can seem kind of contrived, particularly between Wayne and Liam Neeson's character, Ducard, but it sounds so classy you tend not to care. Nolan also puts a lot of trust in his audiences to stay put while the first hour of the film comprehensively explores Bruce Wayne's backstory, with no cape donning and few fight sequences. Nevertheless, the pace never slows, and the story is so unexpected and fascinating (who would have expected a Batman film to begin in a prison in Tibet? only Nolan could pull it off!) there's little chance of us losing interest. And this way, we really get a sense of who Bruce Wayne is, a trait none of the past movies were able to capture, including the Burton films. We see what drives him, what leads him to become this iconic crime fighter, and the reasoning behind the mask.Of course, to help the audience get under Bruce Wayne's skin, it doesn't hurt to have such a talented lead as Christian Bale. Bale has been emerging as one of the most talented actors of his generation, and he brings that talent to a peak here, playing the darkest of all superheroes. If you were to break down the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, you would find that it is essentially three characters: Wayne as Batman, behind the mask; Wayne's public facade as the billionaire playboy; and the real, brooding Bruce Wayne. Bale plays all three of the characters to absolute perfection, and molds them together well enough to make it clear to show they are still the same person. He has been given tons of accolades for his performance already, and needless to say, he deserves every one.And the sheer quality of the supporting cast is mind-boggling, if for the number of big names only. It's very hard to find a weak spot in the incredibly strong array of performances here, but if one had to be found, it would have to be Katie Holmes. It's not that she gives a bad performance, on the contrary, but just she seems too young to be convincing as a district attorney. For me, Michael Gough will always be the definitive Alfred, but Michael Caine does an excellent job of taking over the role, giving a very strong (and often funny) performance. Liam Neeson is sheer class as Ducard, Wayne's mysterious mentor, as is Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Wayne's arms manufacturer and provider of the Batman gear. It's wonderful to see the incredibly talented and much underrated Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon, the only decent cop in Gotham, and he truly makes the role his own. Even cult favorite Rutger Hauer makes an appearance as Richard Earle, the ambitious head of Wayne Enterprises. And (surprise surprise!) the villains are also actually menacing for once, as opposed to cartoony and corny. Cillian Murphy just about walks away with the show as the truly chilling Scarecrow (the sequences involving his 'fear gas' are surprisingly frightening) Ken Watanabe is mysterious and creepy as guild leader Ra's Al Ghul and Tom Wilkinson is very convincing as Carmine Falcone, head of the Gotham city mob. Nolan's knack for realism also comes as a breath of fresh air in this age of CGI bloated blockbusters - there are next to no computer generated shots in the movie, even a sequence with Batman standing on top of a high building staring down at the city was filmed with a stuntman. And it really works, the Batmobile actually interacts with it's environment, and looks so much better real than computer generated. But don't think that the film will come across as too serious and stuffy because of Nolan's realism - true, Gotham seems too dark and dirty to come across as a fantasy world, but Batman Begins retains that unmistakable sense of fun that seems to only be present in comic book movies. We jeer and fear the villains, and cheer the hero as he lays his life on the line to vanquish evil and save the city. And that is how it should be. There's even a surprising twist near the end, which is doubly surprising because it actually comes as a shock. What's not to love here?(and, further cudos to director Nolan for finally managing to make a swarm of bats actually frightening for once)Overall, I'd have to label Batman Begins 'The must see movie of the summer' - it's a well written, authoritatively directed, impeccably acted (especially by Bale's powerhouse lead performance and Cillian Murphy's sickly menacing Scarecrow) and very high quality production. Indeed, most other summer blockbusters could learn a thing or two from Batman Begins. If the Batman franchise died under it's own gaudiness years ago, let us rejoice this glorious rebirth - Batman truly does begin here.-10/10",pyrocitor15,August/2005,10, Why do we fall?

Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993) - IMDb,"Out of all the Batman films so far, including all the live action films, this one is still the only one to really explore the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman and examine what drove him to becoming Batman.It has a great story that flashes back to just before Bruce took up the mantle of the bat and the woman he was involved with at the time, then skips forward to an unknown assassin killing Gotham City's mobsters, and we see how the 2 story's meet. The writing is top-notch, in no-way predictable and the voice acting by Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker truly amazing and bone-chillingly scary.The only complaints is that the animation could have been better at some points, but that is because it was originally meant to be a straight to video release before Warner's saw what a masterpiece they had created, and also it should have run for a little bit longer, but oh well.

Battle Royale II (2003) - IMDb,"BR 2 never finds the errie tone of the first film or novels. I contribute a great deal of this to the ""over the top"" acting and lack of serious character development.What Battle Rotaye 2 does manage to do is pack much more violence into it's running time, and slowly build a very politically incorrect message. I don't agree with the political philosophy here, but I must give Fukasaku credit for having some seriously big balls to make this. Then again, he was dying from cancer so he never had to personnaly face any responsibility. There are many pro Al Quida/ Anti U.S. things going on here, and he hits you over the head with it. From destroying 2 twin towers to living in the mountains of Afghanistan! There is a speech given twice about all the countries the U.S. has bombed (and I agree that America has opened it's self up to global hatred), and it's suggested that Japan goes along with the U.S. cause so many other countries do. The later being Japan's downfall. There is also some anti Israel jabs in a scene showing the children of what looks exactly like West Bank. There is mention of victims of terrorism, but even these characters are easily won over to the side of the terrorist.
This is strong stuff, and I commend Fukasaku for giving me pause to think a little harder about how I stand on global issues.

Big Momma's House (2000) - IMDb,"Martin Lawrence is often trusty in the world of comedy.  Maybe I'm just overcoming his awful ""Blue Streak,"" but I felt this comedy--though saggy at times--was quite funny.  The premise is undoubtedly implausible.  How's a whole neighborhood going to believe that this undercover cop with a latex body that looks somewhat like Big Momma is actually Big Momma?  There's a lot of disbelief to suspend.  But the gags often worked and I can say I laughed about 75 percent of the time.  Some are predictable, like when Big Momma takes a karate class and starts beating the teacher--played by Anthony Anderson--to a pulp, but they still work due to the way they're handled. And Lawrence turns in yet another fine comic performance, with a script that could've used a rewrite but was nowhere near as bad as the crackerjack script he had to work with in ""Blue Streak.""  The talented comic helps keep the movie togehter, with a little assistance from the supporting cast.  Paul Giamatti, who was great as Pig Vomit in the acclaimed ""Private Parts,"" is funny as Lawrence's partner.  We also have ""Me Myself and Irene's"" Anthony Anderson and Cedric the Entertainer.  The plot is chaotic, sometimes predictable, and becomes more and more implausible by the minute but the comedy works and because of that we're able to excuse the script's shortcomings.  ""Big Momma"" doesn't deliver the biggest laughs, but it's good, fun entertainment on a lonely weekday afternoon.

Big Momma's House (2000) - IMDb,"Think of a Mrs. Doubtfire meets the Nutty Professor hybrid, with a smattering of Kindergarten Cop thrown in for good measure, and you've pretty much got Big Momma's House.  Except the former three are all reasonable films, and, unfortunately, Big Momma's House just isn't.When dangerous convict Howard Laster (Terrence Dashon) escapes from prison, undercover cop Malcolm (Martin Lawrence) is sent with fellow FBI agent John (Paul Giamatti) to track down Laster's ex-girlfriend Sherry (Nia Long), in the hope of luring the armed robber back in the direction of the slammer. This involves staking out the house of Sherry's Southern grandmother 'Big Momma', but when the latter leaves town Malcolm feels compelled to take on her guise, with the help of a few prosthetics and some extra padding. Things take a complicated turn, however, when Malcolm begins to fall for the beautiful, yet unknowing, Sherry.The film bounds along like an enthusiastic dog, with the script acting as little more than a vehicle for Big Momma's 'hilarious' antics and various escapades.  The action often degenerates into uninspired gross-out comedy and toilet humour as Big Momma stumbles from one rib-tickling predicament to the next, with Malcolm often only being saved by the former's reputation as a lovable and outlandish character.  Big Momma attends a self-defence class. Big Momma has nasty moments on the toilet.  Big Momma plays basketball. And Big Momma delivers a baby.  Cue many moments of roll-in-the-aisles hilarity.  Or not.Unfortunately, convict Howard is soon forgotten as the film focuses almost solely on Lawrence, and seriously begins to grate as Big Momma's Southern screeches make up about 95% of the dialogue.  The slowly developing romance between Malcolm and Sherry is also guaranteed to make audiences cringe with it's predictability.Lawrence and Giamatti make the best of a bad job, although the audience are left wondering exactly why they took on the roles in the first place, whilst Dashon is convincing as Evil Criminal on the Loose.

Bitch Slap (2009) - IMDb,"It begins with one of our heroines sitting bruised and broken in the middle of carnage and looking up and wondering aloud how it all came to this.I was wondering the same thing.This is a send up/homage/satire of the bad girls gone worse genre that Russ Meyer did so well (for some tastes anyway). It has three well endowed girls going after a fortune held by a crime lord and chronicles the death and destruction that follows. Its very tongue in cheek with an over abundance of close ups of the female form, pithy dialog and lots of violence.The trouble is that the film is essentially sending up material that was sending itself up to start. Meyer was a very knowing filmmaker and its kind of hard to be any more knowing then he was. The other trouble is that in order to send up the material the filmmakers here have tried to take an intentionally ""bad"" take on some things. the bump up and inflate things to the point of silliness. The trouble was that the type of film that they are sending up were more often then not played painfully straight which is what made them so much fun. If you play the material with any sort of real knowing the films become unbearable (Russ Meyer was one of the very few people who ever managed to make the knowingness work).I found the film to be a waste of my time. I get the jokes, I get the idea behind it (I could probably quote you the films this is riffing on) but I don't think it works at all. No thats not true, this is a five minute SNL sketch stretched to 100 minutes. This is one of the couple dozen recent and semi recent films that have been made in the wake of Quentin Tarantino's re-purposing exploitation classics as mainstream films (think Grindhouse, Kill Bill or Inglorious Basterds). Everyone seems to think that they can do what Tarantino does, but its clear that few people understand that he's not just sending up the schlock masterpieces but taking the good parts and making something more out of them (And as much as I complain about Tarantino I must insist that I do so because I think he is wasting his talent).Frankly there are better ways to spend your time, like watching a Russ Meyer film or one of the real exploitation films this film tries to emulate and send up (Better yet, go find one of the films by the late great Claudia Jennings and you'll see how unnecessary this film was).",dbborroughs10,January/2010,3, Weak satire/homage of material that was already a spoof and satire of itself to start with.,0,"[begin, one, heroine, sit, bruise, broken, middle, carnage, look, wonder, aloud, come, wonder, send, bad, girl, go, bad, genre, rus, meyer, well, taste, anyway, three, well, endow, girl, go, fortune, held, crime, lord, chronicle, death, destruction, follows, tongue, cheek, abundance, close, ups, female, form, pithy, dialog, lot, trouble, film, essentially, send, material, send, start, meyer, know, filmmaker, kind, hard, know, trouble, order, send, material, filmmaker, try, take, intentionally, bad, take, thing, bump, inflate, thing, point, silliness, trouble, type, film, send, often, played, painfully, straight, make, much, fun, play, material, sort, real, know, film, become, unbearable, rus, meyer, one, people, ever, ...]","[it, begins, with, of, our heroines, sitting bruised, broken, in, the middle, of, carnage, looking, up, wondering, aloud how, it, came, to, this.i was wondering, the same thing.this, is, a send up/homage/satire, of, the bad girls, gone, worse genre, that, russ meyer, did, so well, for, some tastes, anyway, it, has, well endowed, girls, going, after, a fortune, held, by, a crime lord, chronicles, the death, destruction, follows, its very tongue, in, cheek, with, an over abundance, close, ups, of, the female form, pithy dialog, lots, of, violence.the trouble, is, that, the film, is essentially sending, up, material, was sending, itself, up, to, start, meyer, was, very knowing, filmmaker and its kind, of, hard, to, be, more, knowing, then, he, was, the other trouble, is, that in, order, to, send, up, material, the filmmakers, here have tried, to, take, intentionally, bad, take, on, ...]",15.825682199464927,4.7304307061878115,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,5.798561151079137,139,196,begins heroines sitting bruised broken middle carnage looking wondering aloud came wondering thing send homage satire bad girls gone worse genre russ meyer well tastes anyway well endowed girls going fortune held crime lord chronicles death destruction follows tongue cheek abundance close ups female form pithy dialog lots violence trouble film essentially sending material sending start meyer knowing filmmaker kind hard knowing trouble order send material filmmakers tried take intentionally bad take things bump inflate things point silliness trouble type film sending often played painfully straight made much fun play material sort real knowing films become unbearable russ meyer people ever managed knowingness work found film waste time jokes idea behind could probably quote films riffing think works thats true minute snl sketch stretched 100 minutes couple dozen recent semi recent films made wake quentin tarantinos purposing exploitation classics mainstream films think grindhouse kill bill inglorious basterds everyone seems think tarantino clear people understand sending schlock masterpieces taking good parts making something much complain tarantino must insist think wasting talent frankly better ways spend time like watching russ meyer film real exploitation films film tries emulate send better yet films late great claudia jennings unnecessary film,0.003494623655913991,0.41048387096774197,1
Black Friday (2004) - IMDb,"Films based on books are a rarity in India. Probably that accounts for the huge amount of movies without any coherent screenplay that India churns out. Black Friday, on the other hand, is an exception, which will make any film maker proud.The movie, revolving around the investigation following the horrifying Bombay bomb blasts, and also showing the perpetrators' lives just before and after the incident, took a long time to get through the Censor Board, and it's not difficult to imagine why once you have seen the movie. The movie tries to portray everything the way it actually happened, or at least as the book says it happened, and succeeds. Technically the movie is top league, compared to other Hindi movies, though the editing is choppy in places. The music, by Indian Ocean, is brilliant, and more importantly suits the plot. Despite the length of the movie the director never loses grip, and that's really commendable.I haven't seen Satya (and I am sorry for that), so I am not very familiar with Anurag Kashyap's work (though he also did the dialogues, I believe, for Yuva, which I have seen), but considering the smoke he generates with every movie, I knew there had to be some fire to it too. And Black Friday IS fiery! The movie doesn't ever try to be politically correct and the director is almost obsessed with showing everything - even the correct language - which shall make it unsuitable for family viewing.The actors, with Kay Kay (he should be getting awards for this one) and Aditya Srivastava worth special mention, do a very good job too, and I think many of them are of a theatre background, which ensures a high pedigree in Indian movies. Those familiar with Indian TV serials must have seen Srivastava in an eminently well-made series called 9 Malabar Hill from the late 90s, which also starred Pawan Malhotra. Srivastava has been seen in many other smaller roles in movies and TV serials since then, but that particular role had showed how good an actor he is, and it is proved here once more. Pawan Malhotra is also a known face in India's parallel cinema movement, though he is prone to overact at times. Kay Kay is one of the best actors to have hit the Indian screen in recent years, and brilliant performances aren't new to him.The movie is unique in the sense that it shows the life of a terrorist AFTER the blast and how he copes with all the pressures. Then there's the pressure faced by the investigators to get to the terrorist, but taking care at the same time that they don't harm innocent people in their zeal. When I saw in the credits that the movie was based on a book by a Muslim author, I started feeling that it was going to be a biased description of the atrocities of Mumbai police on innocent members of the Musilm community during the investigations. Such a thought process is shameful, but natural in India's circumstances. But surprisingly, and thankfully, the movie, and so I suppose the book too, is as objective as it could have been without appearing sympathetic to either of the parties.To finish off, this is one of those (very rare) movies that convince you that the future isn't all that bad for Hindi cinema. A must watch for all Hindi movie fans, and even those who normally don't watch Hindi movies because of the unrealistic gloss and song-and-dance routines.",infinitelyprolonged13,May/2005,10, A rare foray by an Indian film maker into gritty real-life drama,1,"[film, base, book, rarity, india, probably, account, huge, amount, movie, without, coherent, screenplay, india, churn, black, friday, hand, exception, make, film, maker, movie, revolve, around, investigation, follow, horrify, bombay, bomb, blast, also, show, perpetrator, life, incident, take, long, time, get, censor, board, difficult, imagine, see, movie, movie, try, portray, everything, way, actually, happen, least, book, say, happen, succeed, technically, movie, top, league, compare, hindi, movie, though, edit, choppy, place, music, indian, ocean, brilliant, importantly, suit, plot, despite, length, movie, director, never, loses, grip, really, see, satya, sorry, familiar, anurag, kashyap, work, though, also, dialogue, believe, yuva, see, consider, smoke, generates, ...]","[films, based, on, books, are, a rarity, in, india, probably, that, accounts, for, the huge amount, of, movies, without, any coherent screenplay, that, india, churns, out, black friday, on, the other hand, is, an exception, will make, any film maker, proud.the movie, revolving, around, the investigation, following, the horrifying bombay bomb blasts, also showing, the perpetrators, lives, just, before, after, the incident, took, a long time, to, get, through, the censor board, it, is, not difficult, to, imagine, why, once, you, have seen, the movie, the movie, tries, to, portray everything, the way it, actually happened, at, least, as, the book, says, it, happened, succeeds, technically, the movie, is, top league, compared, to, other, hindi movies, though, the editing, is, choppy, in, places, the music, by, indian ocean, is, brilliant, more importantly, suits, the plot, despite, the length, of, movie, the director, never loses, grip, ...]",124.44032760417818,-4.644670590126991,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,1,1,4,0,5,5,4,6.009708737864077,206,282,films based books rarity india probably accounts huge amount movies without coherent screenplay india churns black friday hand exception film maker proud movie revolving around investigation following horrifying bombay bomb blasts showing perpetrators lives incident took long time censor board difficult imagine seen movie movie tries portray everything way actually happened least book says happened succeeds technically movie top league compared hindi movies though editing choppy places music indian ocean brilliant importantly suits plot despite length movie director never loses grip really commendable seen satya sorry familiar anurag kashyaps work though dialogues believe yuva seen considering smoke generates every movie knew fire black friday fiery movie ever politically correct director almost obsessed showing everything even correct language shall unsuitable family viewing actors kay kay getting awards aditya srivastava worth special mention good job think many theatre background ensures high pedigree indian movies familiar indian tv serials must seen srivastava eminently well made series called 9 malabar hill late 90s starred pawan malhotra srivastava seen many smaller roles movies tv serials since particular role showed good actor proved pawan malhotra known face indias parallel cinema movement though prone overact times kay kay best actors hit indian screen recent years brilliant performances new movie unique sense shows life terrorist blast copes pressures pressure faced investigators terrorist taking care time harm innocent people zeal saw credits movie based book muslim author started feeling going biased description atrocities mumbai police innocent members musilm community investigations thought process shameful natural indias circumstances surprisingly thankfully movie suppose book objective could without appearing sympathetic either parties finish rare movies convince future bad hindi cinema must watch hindi movie fans even normally watch hindi movies unrealistic gloss song dance routines,0.1723430735930736,0.5338007825507824,1

Blues Brothers 2000 (1998) - IMDb,"Blues Brothers 2000 is a movie with good intentions, Aykroyd and Landis once again team up to recapture the magic in tribute to John Belushi, and almost all of the original cast are still here.

Bodyguard (2011) - IMDb,"After Dabbang and Ready, this film is going to be third consecutive feather in Salman's cap.I felt a little disappointed with the treatment of the movie. The screenplay rushed at an odd pace. The first half was intriguing and speedy, but the second half stammers a bit. Again, in the last 20 minutes, we see a hurricane of emotions.The movie has all the proportionate elements of a Masala Movie, but I seriously felt a letdown in the humor quotient of the movie. The so- called ""Tsunami Singh"" was a high disappointment, rather than him, his T Shirts looked funny. The dialogues were above average.A die-hard Salman fan might get disappointed, but it was a pleasure seeing Salman in a romantic movie; that too; was totally unexpected. Music boosted the movie, due to which, the faulty screenplay gets sidelined.Salman Khan is in top notch here. Kareena is back in the form. Mahesh Manjrekar, Aditya Pancholi, Raj Babbar are remarkable. Rajat Rawail as Tsunami is a letdown. He acts well sans comic timing.Editing by Sanjay Sankla is good, he manages to keep the movie on track in spite of futile screenplay. Cinematography by Sejal Shah is marvelous.

Border (1997) - IMDb,"Border (1997) is an bloody war film filled with an hour's worth of singing. The story is about a company of soldiers (most of the Punjabs) who must defend the India/Pakistan border at all costs. Tensions between the two countries were at the boiling point. The Pakistanis were preparing an all out assault on the Indian border. Based upon a real incident, the actors were great in their roles and the film makers made these characters flesh and blood instead of mere cardboard figures. Each has a tale to tell (in song with a lot of musical numbers). Who will win this incredibly high tensioned battle of survival?A great film. I enjoyed it very much.

Brother 2 (2000) - IMDb,I just watched Brat 2 after ordering a copy from a Russian video store in New York and I was not disappointed. I saw Brat on the International Channel a couple of months ago and was blown away. Ever since I've had been trying to hunt down a copy of Brat 2. While these films are not technically perfect they have a rough hewn charm that no longer exists in most American films. (The lone exception from last year being Spike Jones' Adapation.) Then there's Sergei Bodrov Jr. it is a damn shame that he died last year (along with his film crew in an avalanche) because he was a major talent. He is so damn watchable and the unrelenting honesty of the Danila character makes for a compelling anti-hero in the brother movies that reminds this viewer of the great days of early Brando and Paul Newman.Once again I will remind people to look at the actual vote rating for this film and ignore the silly IMDB weighted total. (The weighted average seems to be based on the strength of the Top 1000 voters whoever they are - it is not however a true weighted average in a classic math sense.)

Cannonball Run II (1984) - IMDb,"Both Cannonball Run movies are films to totally relax and let your funny bone rule you. No plots that make any kind of coherent sense, just a whole lot of people getting a great chance to overact with gusto and abandon. And since Cannonball Run II just about tripled the number of name players who did walk ons, it could be considered triple the fun. Folks like Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise who are the nominal stars, Jackie Chan, Jack Elam, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr., and Jamie Farr make return appearances and a whole lot more get in on the fun.Farr who is carrying the prize money as the fabulously wealthy hedonistic idiot son of an Arab sheik played here by Ricardo Montalban gets to be the target of some gangster heist when the wise guys find out what he's carrying. At that point the contentious rivalries cease among the Cannonballers as they band together against a common foe and to retrieve their prize money.Along for the ride this time with Reynolds and DeLuise are a pair of ersatz nuns played by Shirley MacLaine and Marilu Henner. Martin and Davis now pretend to be cops instead of priests from the last film. They're the chief rivals of Reynolds and DeLuise. Telly Savalas does a great takeoff of his Kojak tough guy image on the other side of the law, Tim Conway and Don Knotts reunite as a pair of brain dead deputies. And Reynolds and DeLuise who pretend to be a general and his aide draft none other than Gomer Pyle on their 'top secret mission'.Frank Sinatra even makes an appearance and it turns out that Cannonball Run II was the farewell big screen role for both he and Dino. As Dino says, he's royalty in America, surely in show business that's what he was.Cannonball Run II which was starting to approach It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World in terms of casting funny people in it and Don Knotts and Sid Caesar are in both is just a film to turn off the gray cells and put the funny bone in hyper drive.",bkoganbing25,January/2013,7, Triple the fun,1,"[cannonball, run, movie, film, totally, relax, let, funny, bone, rule, plot, make, kind, coherent, sense, whole, lot, people, get, great, chance, overact, gusto, abandon, since, cannonball, run, ii, triple, number, name, player, walk, ons, could, consider, triple, fun, folk, like, burt, reynolds, dom, deluise, nominal, star, jackie, chan, jack, elam, dean, martin, sammy, davis, jamie, farr, make, return, appearance, whole, lot, get, carry, prize, money, fabulously, wealthy, hedonistic, idiot, son, arab, sheik, played, ricardo, montalban, get, target, gangster, heist, wise, guy, find, carry, point, contentious, rivalry, cease, among, cannonballers, band, together, common, foe, retrieve, prize, ride, time, reynolds, deluise, pair, ...]","[both cannonball run movies, are, films, to, totally relax, let, your funny bone rule you, no plots, make, any kind, of, coherent sense, just, a whole lot, of, people, getting, a great chance, to, overact, with, gusto, abandon, since, cannonball run ii, just, about, tripled, the number, of, name players, did walk, ons, it, could be considered triple, the fun, folks, like, burt reynolds and dom deluise, are, the nominal stars, jackie chan, jack, elam, dean martin and sammy davis, jr, jamie farr make return appearances, a whole lot, more, get, in on, is carrying, the prize money, as, the fabulously wealthy hedonistic idiot son, of, an arab sheik, played, here, by, ricardo montalban, gets, to, be, the target, of, some gangster heist, when, the wise guys, find, out, he, is carrying, at that, point, the contentious rivalries, cease, among, the cannonballers, as, they, band, together, against, a common foe, to, retrieve, their prize, for, ride, this time, with, reynolds and deluise, are, a pair, of, ersatz nuns, played, by, shirley maclaine and marilu henner, ...]",24.831144289320875,-7.302302851380277,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,5.285714285714286,154,197,cannonball run movies films totally relax let funny bone rule plots kind coherent sense whole lot people getting great chance overact gusto abandon since cannonball run ii tripled number name players walk ons could considered triple fun folks like burt reynolds dom deluise nominal stars jackie chan jack elam dean martin sammy davis jr jamie farr return appearances whole lot fun farr carrying prize money fabulously wealthy hedonistic idiot son arab sheik played ricardo montalban gets target gangster heist wise guys carrying point contentious rivalries cease among cannonballers band together common foe retrieve prize money along ride time reynolds deluise pair ersatz nuns played shirley maclaine marilu henner martin davis pretend cops instead priests last film chief rivals reynolds deluise telly savalas great takeoff kojak tough guy image side law tim conway knotts reunite pair brain dead deputies reynolds deluise pretend general aide draft none gomer pyle top secret mission frank sinatra even makes appearance turns cannonball run ii farewell big screen role dino dino says royalty america surely show business cannonball run ii starting approach mad mad mad mad world terms casting funny people knotts sid caesar film turn gray cells put funny bone hyper drive,0.07279693486590037,0.6668582375478928,1
Cannonball Run II (1984) - IMDb,"This film has no race and no chase. Okay there is a race but it has really nothing to do with the movie. The first film of course is all about ""The Cannonball Run"", which is an illegal race from coast to coast, written by Brock Yates who, along with director Hal Needham, actually drove an ambulance across America - and it's Yates who invented the Cannonball Run. In the original, Burt and Dom use the very same ambulance; now we have a sequel which isn't written by Yates, and is as bad a sequel as I've yet to witness on screen. As mentioned, the actual coast to coast race has little to do with anything this time around. Instead there's a lame subplot about mobsters trying to hijack Jamie Farr's character, an Arab with tons of oil money who this time around is funding the prize at the finish line. So basically this is a comic mobster film with a bunch of actors thrown in who are driving cars. Jack Elam, who is incredible in the first film, is thrown in as wallpaper. Burt and Dom are horrible and lazy; you can tell they were just doing the film for a paycheck. Shirley Maclaine and Marilu Henner play actresses dressed as nuns, and we have to sit through people doing double-takes as these impostor penguins curse in public. Boring. Horrible. Jackie Chan is even ruined this time around. In the first film Roger Moore plays a guy who thinks he's Roger Moore, and thus he drives a gadget filled car, ala Bond. This time around, Chan, who had some gadgets of his own in the original, has even more gadgets as he's basically replacing the Moore/Bond character from the original. And his driver is Richard Kiel, best known as Bond nemesis ""Jaws"". Chan's car even goes under water, just like Bond's car in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" (which featured Kiel). Other contestants include an ape teamed up with Tony Danza. All I have to ask Tony is: Didn't ""Going Ape"" teach you not to work with primates? Jamie Farr's character is ruined because he's too involved; his sheik was far better as a cameo in the original. And Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr are totally wasted this time, disguised as cops instead of priests, and they don't even get into any trouble. Burt and Dom are dressed as soldiers; Burt is a general and Dom is a private. They pick up Jim Nabors along the way, as ""Private Lyle"" (guess what they're spoofing here?) and his cameo is as useless as an air conditioner in an igloo. It doesn't feel as if there is any ""need"" to win the race for any of the characters. You forget there is even a race at all. Man, I tell you, this is one of the worst sequels - if not the worst sequel ever, ever, ever made. Avoid it at all costs.

Captain America: Civil War (2016) - IMDb,"I don't understand the hate for this movie it actually surprised me, I really enjoyed this film. Captain America: Civil War is a descent awesome MCU super action the third film of the Captain America trilogy. To me the second movie Captain America: The Winter Soldier is still the best one I just love that movie to death, but I like this one I love the first one but I just love all three of Captain America films. I thought the cast did a good job Chris Evens kicks ass once again he is Captain America and I look this movie from his point of view. He is really become my favorite hero of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the Avengers films especially Age of Ultron, Captain America is still a guy who has a lot of screen time that it is the focus of a movie and he is still the guy I can take a side I agree with him, I can understand his choices.We have also almost everyone from Avengers films except Thor and Hulk actors Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo did not appear. Chris Hemsworth thought that MCU fired him because he was not cast as Thor but he was later explained that MCU wants his own movie and his own stand alone path which I can't wait for Thor: Ragnarok.The cast beside Chris Evens includes Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt, and Daniel Brühl.In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions-one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. We have two opposite teams now fighting each other: Team Iron Man: War Machine, Black Widow, Black Panther, The Vision, Spider-Man.Team Captain America: Hawkeye, Sharon Carter, Falcon, Bucky Barnes, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch.The battle between Captain America and Iron Man draws a political line in the sand. On one side, you have Tony Stark, a man looking to protect the world from super-powered individuals who've proved in the past to be more destructive than helpful. On the other, you have Steve Rogers championing civil liberties. It's the age old debate of safety coming at the cost of freedom, and we'll get to see it play out to a hopefully satisfying conclusion this year.The action scenes are fantastic, the fight scenes on the airport are incredible heart pulse breath taking awesome. The fight scenes were very well done and well choreographed. I liked this movie more the story drew me in, the villain wasn't that good.Robert Downey Jr. does a good job, Paul Rudd he is fun in the flick, he has a great moment as Ant-Man he has a few moments but one predictable. Scarlett Johansson did great! Black Widow kicked ass specially in the beginning of the flick. Anthony Mackie I really like him as Falcon he as a lot of good stuff in this. He was down played in Age of Ultron but has a lot screen time in here which was excellent and they made that for that in this one I am glad for it. Anthony Mackie has a lot of good screen time, specially in the action moments. Falcon has a remote control like a mini Flacon I thought that was really cool. Chris Evens is to root for this character, Black Panther interesting the actor playing black panther was really good I like him and I am really interested seeing his up coming movie. Bucky Barnes: Winter Soldier did fine.A lot of people are complain about how terrible this movie is I am sorry I don't see it that way, I don't see at all it is peace of sh**. I wish that Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow / Crossbones wouldn't die and it was nice to see him in the beginning of the movie. I still wish he would work for the villain I still enjoy his screen time.I thought Chris Evens and Robert Downey Jr, did work great as a opposite team. I love the end of fighting between Cap, Iron Man and Bucky Barnes. I thought the last fight scene was well choreographed I honestly think Iron Man would have won and he would killed Bucky Barnes. If Cap wouldn't have hurt his heart. I know when Tony find out Bucky killed his parents and he killed his mom in 1991 he decide to kill him. I mourn with Tony and it was a great dialogue ""That shield doesn't belong to you. You don't deserve it! My father made that shield!"" Captain America: Civil War is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.I understand the hate, because Captain turn the law politics back to save his friend, but he actually try to safe an innocent man who was framed by Zemo. Captain America Civil War WAS BETTER THAN X-MEN APOCALYPSE, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Man of Steel and Deadpool I don't like those movies they are peace of sh** and too way overrated.

Captain America: Civil War (2016) - IMDb,"The WINTER SOLDIER is the best MCU film, but its sequel has a serious identity crisis. Captain America: Civil War wants to be great. But for the most part it isn't. The film is an overstuffed 2 and half hour film that has one too many ideas thrown into the mix. It is essential a cash grab of the BVS variety. But why can't people see this? Now this is a Captain America as the title suggests. But in the end a more fitting title would read: Bucky VS Ironman: Dawn of who's the Captain's Bestie. The reason I say this is the film felt disjointed to the point of it being a joke. It felt like two separate films weaved together to try and make a film that makes sense. But it didn't It's one half a Captain flick/ the other half a mini Avengers film. But they both drown each other. It's clear this is a film Marvel wanted to make, but why on earth rush into it? One film could never service this iconic plot line. It should have been gradual, and while we did see Cap and Tony tense up in Ultron, this is where a strain in their relationship should have been definite and it should have still been in effect at the beginning of this film.For the most part of the Airport sequence there was no real danger. It was a carefully orchestrated scene that showed these films are for young cinema-goers. Even when one character is looked to be written off ""BAM"" they are back, giving everyone some cheep laughs at the end of the film. Now from a writing and filmmaking point of view and dare I say it, this film has worse interconnecting scenes then The Amazing Spiderman 2. Re-shoots are obvious, editing is sub par, cinematography lacked style and was evident to be a ""quick"" point-and-shoot at the action affair. Such a disappointment. But yes this film has it's fun moments (the same can not be said for BVS). But they can't help a film tailored to a certain demographic that leaves out those looking for a film that doesn't kill a few braincell upon leaving the cinema. The laughs are hardly inspirational writing and forced, so forced.sidetone: ONLY SOME OF THEM HAVE SUPER POWERS, SO WHY DO THEY ALL RECOVER FROM HARD HITS AND KNOCKS? it's just makes the stakes so much lower and less respectable.",nathanianhenderson1,May/2016,4, Overstuffed and Undercooked,0,"[winter, soldier, best, mcu, film, sequel, serious, identity, crisis, captain, america, civil, war, want, great, part, film, overstuffed, half, hour, film, one, many, idea, thrown, mix, essential, cash, grab, bvs, variety, people, see, captain, america, title, suggests, end, fitting, title, would, read, bucky, v, ironman, dawn, captain, bestie, reason, say, film, felt, disjoint, point, joke, felt, like, two, separate, film, weave, together, try, make, film, make, sense, one, half, captain, half, mini, avenger, film, drown, clear, film, marvel, want, make, earth, rush, one, film, could, never, service, iconic, plot, line, gradual, see, cap, tony, tense, ultron, strain, relationship, definite, still, ...]","[the winter soldier, is, the best mcu film, its sequel, has, a serious identity crisis, captain america, civil war, wants, to, be, great, for, the most part it, is, not, the film, is, overstuffed, 2 and half hour film, has, one too many ideas, thrown, into, the mix, it, is essential, a cash grab, of, the bvs, variety, why, cannot, people, see, now, is, a captain america, as, the title suggests, in, end, a more fitting title, would read, bucky vs ironman, dawn, of, is, the captain, bestie, the reason i, say, is, the film, felt disjointed, to, the point, of, it, being, a joke, it, felt, like, two separate films, weaved, together, to, try, make, a film, makes, sense, it, did, not, it, is, half a captain, flick/, other, half a mini avengers, film, they, drown, each other, it, is clear, is, a film marvel, wanted, to, make, why, on, earth rush, into, it, one film, could, ...]",9.027016360790103,-6.833810246644696,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,5.613793103448277,145,184,winter soldier best mcu film sequel serious identity crisis captain america civil war wants great part film overstuffed 2 half hour film many ideas thrown mix essential cash grab bvs variety people captain america title suggests end fitting title would read bucky vs ironman dawn captains bestie reason film felt disjointed point joke felt like separate films weaved together film makes sense half captain flick half mini avengers film drown clear film marvel wanted earth rush film could never service iconic plot line gradual cap tony tense ultron strain relationship definite still effect beginning film part airport sequence real danger carefully orchestrated scene showed films young cinema goers even character looked written bam giving everyone cheep laughs end film writing filmmaking point view dare film worse interconnecting scenes amazing spiderman 2 shoots obvious editing sub par cinematography lacked style evident quick point shoot action affair disappointment yes film fun moments said bvs help film tailored certain demographic leaves looking film kill braincell upon leaving cinema laughs hardly inspirational writing forced forced sidetone super powers recover hard hits knocks makes stakes much lower less respectable,0.11488095238095242,0.4293067226890755,1
Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) - IMDb,"With Rogers, Fury, and Romanoff previously established, directors Joe and Anthony Russo do a magnificent job at expanding these characters – along with some secondary characters we've seen before – providing more depth to understanding their actions and how they will affect future stories. Sam Jackson has a stronger presence this time around, validating Nick Fury as a main staple in the MCU among the big boys. Captain America is stronger, faster, and a more refined soldier, equipped with better fighting skills and understanding of current technology. Evans plays the earnestness of Captain America's black and white morality with convincing finesse in an age of grey that he has yet to find a comfortable middle. And Johansson progresses the allure of the cunning and multifaceted Black Widow, while bringing a splendid and lively balance to Rogers' straight and narrow.Amidst such a tight and clever script, The Winter Soldier introduces a band of new characters, all of whom play a significant role, creating a more layered and conceivably real MCU. Frank Grillo brings the swolling mass of muscle known as S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Brock Rumlow to life. Emily VanCamp surprises with her portrayal of Agent 13, whom I wish had more screen time with Cap than just two quick scenes. Robert Redford plays Alexander Pierce, a superior ranking Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., friend to Nick Fury, and representative of the World Security Council. Pierce is a wonderful look into the higher ranks at S.H.I.E.L.D., contributing new insights as to how the organization is run outside of Fury, Agent Coulson, and Agent Maria Hill. Anthony Mackie is Sam Wilson aka The Falcon, an ex-military special-ops paratrooper and a welcomed addition recruited by Rogers to help fight the good fight. Mackie fits comfortably among the cast of veteran actors and should play nicely with the other Avengers.Enhanced for combat and strength, The Winter Soldier's presence is terrifying when it comes to any action scene. Sebastian Stan does an amazing job holding his own against his targets and those who get in his way of his missions. My only gripe is that it is not explained how he obtains the immense power and skills he beholds. The connection between Rogers and The Winter Soldier is dealt with true care and excels the story of Captain America from the first film brilliantly. (Be sure to stay after the credits for a nice button leading into Captain America 3.) The Winter Soldier is not just a fantastic sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers, it should also be recognized as one of the best sequels ever made. In fact, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the duo behind Thor: The Dark World, the Narnia Trilogy, and The First Avenger, have done such a great job shaping Captain America's story that this movie could almost stand on its own. There are many exciting twists and turns in this well-constructed, political action-thriller, but nothing comes as more of a shock than how important the story is at defining the direction of the MCU. What takes place in The Winter Soldier, along with an awesome mid-credits sequence tie-in, will inherently influence Avengers: Age of Ultron as well as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. – which should make the TV series a lot more interesting and reward fans who have stuck by its side.Tonally, The Winter Soldier is the darkest story we've come to encounter, raising many deep-seated questions about government and soldiers of war while also taking Rogers on an emotional journey. It also has the best action choreography among all of the MCU movies thus far. Whedon's NYC battle in The Avengers is beautifully shot and written, but cannot compare to the hard-hitting set pieces found in The Winter Soldier, each building up to the bigger whole. The Russo brothers come from a background of directing television comedies such as Arrested Development and Community, and it's extraordinary how well they handle a big budget action blockbuster from cinematography to pacing. They do infuse their own style of comedy with fun references and a cameo other than Stan Lee, functioning properly within the confines of the tone and story. Henry Jackman (Captain Phillips; Wreck-It Ralph; X-Men: First Class) also composes an adrenaline pumping score that sets the right mood every time.The biggest fault found in The Winter Soldier is that it does not address the whereabouts of other heroes or where we are in terms of the time line of the other movies. Why can't Captain America call on Tony Stark to help him out or even Hawkeye who is a member of S.H.I.E.L.D. himself. This is a recurring problem we have seen throughout Phase 2 of the MCU in Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World. Marvel Studios needs to acknowledge this hiccup if they want us to continue to believe all of these characters live in the same universe together. You cannot exclude these characters once you have opened Pandora's Box.Marvel Studios has hit this one out of the ball park with yet another gripping adaptation for fans to enjoy for years to come. By and large, Captain America: The Winter Soldier succeeds on all fronts. It is the perfect set up for future films and at the same time it increases the value of its predecessors. There is little to argue against its merits and should be regarded as one of the greatest superhero movies of all time.",TyRawrrnosaurus23,March/2014,9, A Thrilling Sequel that Raises the Bar for

Captain Blood (1935) - IMDb,"This is remembered as Errol Flynn's great opening movie role - which is partly true. He had a nice career in Australian movies (one a film about Fletcher Christian and the Bounty), but CAPTAIN BLOOD was his first Hollywood film as a star, and it was a brilliantly colorful opening role.Flynn plays Dr. Peter Blood, a physician who is the 1685 version of Dr. Samuel Mudd in the Assassination of Lincoln. Mudd, if you recall, treated John Wilkes Booth's broken leg, and was sentenced to life imprisonment as a result. Flynn treats some injured men not realizing they are soldiers in a revolt. When they are arrested so is he, and he ends up being transported as an indentured servant (little better than a slave) to Jamaica in the West Indies.The revolt, by the way, is that of James, Duke of Monmouth. The son of one Lucy Walters, his father was supposed to be King Charles II, one of several lovers Walters had when James was born. King Charles had ennobled Monmouth, and treated him well at court, but refused to legitimize him as the Whigs hoped (they wanted the Protestant Monmouth on the throne, rather than the Catholic brother of Charles, James, Duke of York. In the end Monmouth led this ill-fated revolt, which was defeated at the battle of Sedgewick Moor. Monmouth was beheaded at the Tower of London. King James II (the former Duke of York) sent his most belligerent jurist, Judge George Jeffreys to the west country where hundreds were hanged at fast trials (known forever after as ""The Bloody Assizes"". Jeffreys appears in the film as the judge that orders Blood's transporting to the New World. However in the film Blood (desperate to prove he is just a doctor) says the judge is suffering from tuberculosis. Jeffeys actually suffered from kidney stones, and was a heavy drinker and curser as a result. King James II made him Lord Chancellor for his work.Flynn's real adventures begin in Jamaica, where he is working at the estate of Colonel Bishop (Lionel Atwill) and his niece Arabella (Olivia De Haviland). It was the first film Flynn and De Haviland co-starred in. Atwill is a bully to these traitorous indentured servants, but Flynn's medical abilities raises him above the others. With the aid of two local doctors he plans an escape, and he and the other indentured servants (Guy Kibbee, Ross Alexander, etc.) escape after defeating a pirate attack on the island. They also have the pleasure of plundering and discomforting Atwill, who vows to hunt them down and destroy them. The only regret Flynn has in leaving is he and Arabella have fallen in love.We watch the rise of Peter Blood as a leading pirate, his temporary partnership with the French pirate Captain Lavasseur (Basil Rathbone) - which ends in a duel over De Haviland (and the first time Rathbone had to die at Flynn's hand in a duel in their films), and his gradual emergence as a friend of a reformed England represented by Lord Willoughby (Henry Stephenson) after the ""Glorious Revolution"" of 1688 overthrows James II. Although not exactly the same, Blood's rise from Pirate king to Governor of Jamaica (as the film ends) is a mirror of the story (a decade earlier) of the rise of Pirate, Henry Morgan, to being Sir Henry Morgan, Lt. Governor/Governor of Jamaica. A closer acting job regarding Morgan was done by Laird Cregar in THE BLACK SWAN, where he played that Governor - and with a welsh accent. But Flynn does very nicely, with his charm, humor, good looks, and athletic grace.

Casino Royale (2006) - IMDb,"Casino Royale (2006) is without doubt one of the best Ian Fleming's James Bond. This is the real film, the real Bond film unlike lackluster sh**y Die Another Day stupid movie! I have enjoyed this film so damn much! I love this film to death, from action sequence to actors and the plot story I love it. The film is very realistic serious well portrayed it has no jokes. It is my favorite because it is action, action, action and even more action. Casino Royale (2006) is the twenty-first spy film in the Eon Productions James Bond film series, and is the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's 1953 novel of the same name.I make no apologies for believing that Daniel Craig really did become the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond. I'm a hard-core James Bond fan I love a lot of the films that over 50 years were made. Casino Royale is simply my third favorite James Bond film it is in my top 10 favorite James Bond films. This movie is interesting totally mind-blowing. It is highly entertaining, espionage with a lot of action sequence. Not boring or lame but believable well acted.After lackluster fiasco and disaster Die Another Day (2002) producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli fired actor Pierce Brosnan because he wanted too much money to shoot a fifth Bond movie, and producers had already decided to reboot the long-running spy saga with a grittier approach. Daniel Craig ultimately took over the role for 2006's Casino Royale and has gone on to achieve success as arguably the most popular 007 since the days of Sean Connery.Daniel Craig is fantastic as new James Bond tough I love Pierce Brosnan this is the real deal. Actress Samantha Bond also left James Bond saga after 4 movies since Brosnan was fired and this movie did not used Miss Moneypenny.Eva Green as the new Bond's girl Vesper Lynd did an excellent performance and a fine job playing James Bond's first true love. Green and Craig have electric chemistry on screen together. Vesper's character seems ambiguous, impudent and complicated. One night-slumped in the shower fully clothed, radiating inner beauty-her quiet look is capable to melt Bond's cold heart and free his doubtful mind. In another, she disconcerts him with her pretty 'Algerian love knot.Judi Dench as M is always awesome and she did a fantastic well done job. In GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World is Not Enough and this movie she did a well done excellent job. I love the actress and I had a blast watching her on screen.Mads Mikkelsen is the villain banker Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) who tries to get rich in supplying funds for terrorists. The actor did incredible job as the main villain and I really absolutely loved his performance.Jeffrey Wright plays the new undercover CIA agent Felix Leiter 'bleeding chips at the poker tournament:' and Giancarlo Giannini plays the 'contact' Mathis.The Italian actress Caterina Murino plays Solange who reveals her sexy side as the frustrated woman so upset in her marriage.Armed with a license to kill, Secret Agent James Bond sets out on his first mission as 007, and must defeat a private banker to terrorists in a high stakes game of poker at Casino Royale, Montenegro, but things are not what they seem.Bond (Daniel Craig) is chasing a terrorist bomber Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan) who was contracted by terrorist organization to make and sell a bomb. While Bond chases him he has to jump on a several sky cranes and on a building to continue the chase. Real stunt performance from stunt man and actor Daniel Craig. He chases Mollaka to embassy in Madagascar and shots him and shoots a nearby gas tank makes a huge explosion and flees with Mollaka's bag, he finds his cell phone with text message the word ""ELLIPSIS."" A trail leads Bond to Nassau, Bahamas to Alex Dmitrios (Simon Abkarian) in which Bond seduces his wife Solange and find's out he goes to Miami USA. Bond pursues Dmitrios to Miami airport kills Dmitrios with a knife in self defense tracks down another bomber. Bond stops the terrorist and takes the bomb away from the airplane. Saves all the passengers and the plane. Great tanker truck chase on the airport. Great action sequence Bond saves over 200 lives in this movie that is why I love it so much. Bond stops the tanker before hitting the plane with all the gas and the bomb attached to it and he attaches bomb on a terrorist. Excellent action sequence! Bond has to fight Le Chiffre in high poker game with Felix Leiter. Bond kill's two black men in which Le Chiffre lost their money and single handle with fists kill's them. Bond is such a bad-ass in this movie. Le Chiffre and his blond girl Valenka (Ivana Milicevic) poison Bond's martini with digitalis, causing Bond to suffer severe tachycardia. Bond runs to his car for defibrillator but passes out. Vesper Lynd comes and save's his life. Bond comes back in to Casino finishes the game and beats Le Chiffre at the game. Bond drives Aston Martin DBS great action sequence.10/10 This movie is directed by Martin Campbell who directed GoldenEye my all time favorite Pierce Brosnan 007 film.

Casino Royale (2006) - IMDb,"If you consider yourself a James Bond fan and yet enjoyed this film, there is a problem.Just like everyone else, when I first saw that Daniel Craig was to replace Pierce Brosnan in the role, I was a bit confused. His ice cold looks seemed to be quite a stretch from the image we have of James Bond. Maybe ""they"" know some things I don't about 007, maybe I've been missing something about the character. Plus,the hype around the production was excellent,the rumor was that the filmmakers have decided to be more daring in many aspects. Nothing wrong with that, as a long as you know what you're doing.But at the very first frame of the film,my original skepticism re-emerged:The opening scene happens in a sombre black and white cold war setting in which Bond makes no spectacular entrance, chatting with his enemy and finishing the mission with his fists inside a...dirty public restroom. Then Bond spins around, aiming his gun at the camera, taking the classic pose. Right then, I couldn't help myself but noticing the restroom tiles in the background(!) and this blond muscular hunk in the center of the screen suggesting: "" I am your NEW James Bond!"". ""Not yet,gentlemen"" did I think.Still, let's give them a second chance, here comes the long-awaited opening credits. A beautiful animation of paisley patterns and stylized men fighting in slow-motion,turning into flying hearts,spades,clubs and diamonds at each blow. But something is missing: where are the gorgeous nude feminine silhouettes? Where are the girls? Gone !!! Why???!!! At this point, I feared the worst: did the producers decide purposely to get rid of everything we actually loved about James Bond?! But here comes hope:James Bond chases a man through a building site,climbing on cranes, jumping and falling hard. Great, this might not be a real James Bond flick, but at least, we're in for some good entertainment. Right?Wrong: The rest of the film is nothing but a long (two and a half hours long!)demonstration on how to annihilate a movie landmark character.No Monneypenny,no ""Q"",no ""R"", and every time ""M"" (Judi Drench) appears on the screen, the ONLY thing she ever does is begging Bond to stop doing what he's doing and come back to his senses. Yet,all I could hear from her was: ""What have you done to James Bond? Who are you, blond man?! Why don't you ever smile? Why don't you ever say anything witty? How come the only gadget you use is a cell phone? How dare you wreck THE 1964 Aston Martin in only 3 minutes? How could you fall in love with such a boring girl? What do you want from us? Bring us back England's most precious hero!""The other characters barely exist: The villain, named Le Chiffre, is a card player who's task is to finance terrorism by playing poker. Does he cheat ? no. Why? He might be a villain, but will not take his cruelty as far as... cheating! We know he's the villain since his left eye bleeds once in a while and he acts like everything is fine. Who knows,maybe someday,we'll get to see a villain who plays Monopoly with a runny nose. So scary.Then I thought: ""I get it! His damaged eye is in fact a technological wonder that allows him to see the other player's cards thanks to the mysterious blond girl, in the background, who's eye is a camera placed surgically inside her head and feeds Le Chiffre with her own vision! Great!"". Was I right ? Of course not, that would be something you'd see in a James Bond film...But here comes the most sacrilegious scene EVER to come out of a James Bond film:James Bond (let's keep using this name, for the lack of a better one) is taken prisoner and dragged in a basement, he is entirely stripped from his clothes and attached on a chair without a seat, letting 007's ""genitals"" dangling from underneath (Yes,you heard right). Le Chiffre proceeds to swing a large heavy rope and hits her majesty's favorite secret agent's nuts over and over. Bond screams in pain but does not reveal the bank account number. What a man. Does he escape? Does he fight back in the most ingenious manner and eliminates his torturer? No, he passes out and wakes up in a hospital.The torture may have stopped for Bond, but increases for me: Bond finds comfort in the arms of his girlfriend Vesper (yes, girlfriend) who tells him, to rebuild his pride, that even if the only thing left from him was his little finger, she would still love him. To which, the emasculated James Bond replies (watch out, humor coming your way): ""That's because you know what I can do with my little finger."" Can we please stop talking about mister Bond smashed testicles and go on with this never-ending-going-nowhere-story?! And don't we know that if Bond was ever blown to smithereens, the only thing left from him should precisely be his genitals?There were other problems with the film of course,such as the boring story, and the fact that the casino (which seemed to be the perfect setting for a James Bond film) turned out to be so poorly exploited.Giving this film one star might not be fair (do you ever read a review unless it has a 1 or a 10 star rating?),but the main problem goes beyond the bad choices added by the filmmakers throughout the film. The problem is that the film was made with the wrong ""spirit"" and doesn't take in consideration that, unlike other movies, James Bond belongs more to the public than to its makers, and that this rare fact deserves to be honored.Don't mess with MY James Bond.",sandy-kopi19,November/2006,1," ""Bordello Royale""",0,"[consider, james, bond, fan, yet, enjoy, film, like, everyone, else, first, saw,

Catch .44 (2011) - IMDb,"There's quite a few claims that this film is a Tarantino rip-off. People are saying the lines and acting are terrible, and even that it's the ""worst movie ever,"" etc. First, this is FAR from the WORST movie ever. If you're in that boat, you're either being overly dramatic, or you really haven't seen many bad films. The acting isn't horrible, but you might cringe a few times - and don't expect any awards nominations. Where the film really falls short is the (lack of) character development. We don't really have a lot of reasons or get the chance to care about the characters or what happens to them. And no, Bruce Willis doesn't dominate the screen. This film does have a Tarantino-feel, but it's obviously not a Tarantino, nor does it sell itself as such. I honestly went into this with zero expectations other than seeing the beautiful Deborah Ann Woll in something other than True Blood - Bruce Willis and Forest Whitaker being in the movie was a big, big plus. It's slower-paced and a bit predictable, but it's not bad. If you're expecting a fast-paced and/or ""Tarantino brilliant"" rehash of Die Hard-meets-Pulp Fiction/Reservoir Dogs, then you're setting yourself up for a huge disappointment.

Cell (2016) - IMDb,"When I first read Cell many years ago, I instantly thought it could be transferred to an amazing movie. (And funnily enough, even cast the same actors in my eyes for both Clay and Tom.)However, the final product for the big screen was such a let down.. Though the scenes they took from the book were fairly accurate, they cut out at least 40% of the content. (Most of which is integral to the story telling and explaining what has actually happened.. The Raggedy Man / Red Hoodie Guy being one major oversight.)I feel like if you hadn't read the book to begin with, you'll probably find yourself getting lost too easily.. There was a severe lack of pacing simply jumping from scene to scene and some changes which in my opinion were for the worst.Overall I did still enjoy the movie, has a fairly unique concept and some very disturbing imagery, but had I have not read the book prior I don't think it'd be getting anywhere near 6/10 from me.SUMMARY: GO READ THE BOOK INSTEAD, AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING READ.",shaddixauth11,June/2016,6, Disappointed Book Reader,1,"[first, read, cell, many, year, ago, instantly, thought, could, transfer, amaze, movie, funnily, enough, even, cast, actor, eye, clay, tom, however, final, product, big, screen, let, though, scene, take, book, fairly, accurate, cut, least, content, integral, story, tell, explain, actually, raggedy, man, red, hoodie, guy, one, major, oversight, feel, like, read, book, begin, probably, find, get, lose, severe, lack, pace, simply, jumping, scene, scene, change, opinion, still, enjoy, movie, fairly, unique, concept, disturb, imagery, read, book, prior, think, would, get, anywhere, near, go, read, book, instead, absolutely, amaze, read]","[when, i first read, cell, many years, ago, i, instantly thought, it, could be transferred, to, an amazing movie, funnily enough, even, cast, the same actors, in, my eyes, for, both clay, tom.)however, the final product, for, the big screen, was such, let, down, though, the scenes they, took, from, the book, were, fairly accurate, they, cut, out at, least, of, the content, most, of, is integral, to, the story, telling, explaining, has actually happened, the raggedy man, red hoodie guy, being, one major oversight.)i feel, like if, you, had not read, the book, to, begin, with, you, will probably find, yourself, getting lost, too easily, was, a severe lack, of, pacing simply jumping, from, scene, to, scene, some changes, in, my opinion, were, for, the worst.overall i, did still enjoy, the movie, has, a fairly unique concept, some very disturbing imagery, had, i, have not read, the book, prior i, do not think, it, would be getting, anywhere, near, from, go, read the book, instead, an absolutely amazing read]",-101.30948859819115,-2.15208859259861,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,3,2,4,0,2,0,0,4,4,5,5.296296296296297,81,94,first read cell many years ago instantly thought could transferred amazing movie funnily enough even cast actors eyes clay tom however final product big screen let though scenes took book fairly accurate cut least 40 content integral story telling explaining actually happened raggedy man red hoodie guy major oversight feel like read book begin probably getting lost easily severe lack pacing simply jumping scene scene changes opinion worst overall still enjoy movie fairly unique concept disturbing imagery read book prior think would getting anywhere near 6 10 summary read book instead absolutely amazing read,0.08731060606060609,0.5192640692640693,1
Cell (2016) - IMDb,"First... I did not know anything about this awesome, and I can't say that enough, awesome book becoming a movie. I have had to read this book at least 10 times over the last few years and some of my most favorite life quotes came from this book. So when I saw this as a movie and John as the main role I knew it was going to be amazing. I mean if I could cast the main character myself it would be John.BUT... Well, if the director had made a movie out of the book, it would have been amazing. If the movie had any of the most notable and required pieces of the plot it would have been amazing. If the director had even read anything to do with the book, even the dust jacket, it would have been amazing. But he didn't, he didn't, he didn't.SO... The movie sucked. I don't like to use that type of ""language"" when reviewing anything, but there is no other choices here. Everything about the movie was wrong and I gave it a lot of room, a lot of space to make errors and not flow the same. Because ultimately you want to be surprised by the movie. You ultimately want the director to make it his own just a little bit, put his spin on something and have it shine even more. And I did, I watched the movie to the very end. Checked behind the credits and everything. And now I wish I would have gone on for the rest of my life without knowing this movie existed. IF... Now one might think by my review that had you not read the book, you might have liked it but sadly that is not true. This is not only the worst adaptation of a book ever, but it is also just poorly put together, scripted, acted, and there is no redeemable quality anywhere.Such as... The sound effects were horrible, the video tried to be dark and creepy, but it was just bland. There was very little action or scare factor other than some BOO moments from the ""zombies type people."" If you didn't see something coming from a mile away it is because it made no sense. The ending was a little baffling on how horrible it was. I mean I am actually trying to think of one thing. Just one that I can say and would take this movie from a 1 star to at least a 1.5 star. But I can't. I can't think of a single thing that I can look back on and say that was cool/nice/awesome/not terrible.Lastly... So I will leave you with this. I am actually praying that I reach you before you watched this movie. I am hoping one of your not nice friends didn't play a prank on you and made you pay for this movie. It is my desire that this review has reached you before you have wasted one single heartbeat within the vicinity of this horrible, horrible film mistake.

Cell 211 (2009) - IMDb,"This movie likens that of a gemstone- raw, real, unique, crafty and incomparable. I watched this movie, my first Spanish movie in cinema, with English subtitles and frankly, i was impressed. Though now the only regret i have is not mastering the language before the show. If only i could pay more attention to the movie instead of the translated words running at the bottom.This is a story of a prison guard, Juan Oliver (played by Alberto A) who decided to go to work one day before he actually begins to 'make an impression'. What awaits him later is a riot, which forced him to be locked in Cell 211 after suffering an injury to his head. He knows the only way to live is to be one of them, and so he acted as an inmate. But until when can he keep it to himself? He has to make peace with the rest of the inmates and gain the trust of their 'leader' Malamadre (played by Luis Tosar) as they take hostage of high profile, terrorist-prisoners. He later learns an ugly news of his pregnant wife outside prison and his life is never the same again.This movie plays around the humanity of man and how corruption and distrust can affect a man's freedom and ultimately, his life. There were moments in the show. Obviously, the prison riot. The police riot scene later was well delivered straight to its core, which led to the falling domino pieces in the movie. The turning point of Juan's character was when he received the news about his wife. Fine acting by all the cast with amazing characterization, awesome cinematography and directing at every scene!The development of the plot is great, at points where it creates suspense left me on the edge of my seat. The blossoming relationship between Juan and Malamadre is well crafted, and believable- that i don't see in many other movies these days. It felt like Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes.Walking out the cinema, i was left to ponder at many questions with respect to the show. Why was Juan left in Cell 211 at the first place? As if a curse is cast to the cell. It will be interesting to watch the Hollywood remake of the movie in two years time and i hope it does remain to its authenticity. Definitely award-worthy, it accentuates prison drama at its best- pulling heartstrings despite its violence and vulgar language.My cinematic experience has truly broadened.

Code Name: The Cleaner (2007) - IMDb,"Cedric the Entertainer is certainly a talented comedian, but with a script this boring and stupid, even he couldn't breathe life into this horrible mess of a comedy. Despite the bad reviews, I was still slightly eager to check out the movie. The year has just started and already I have a candidate for the worst movies of 2007. The spy comedy has been done to death. And the fact that the writers had nothing new to bring to the table didn't help. I must've chuckled a total of 5 times, and received no laughs whatsoever. As the movie (thankfully) approached its conclusion, I jokingly thought to myself, ""This is probably one of those flicks that contains a gag reel over the closing credits."" Well...I was right! I frequently disapprove of gag reels over the credits of good movies. When you show a gag reel after a bad movie, it's like rubbing salt on a wound. The only part of this movie worth checking out is Nicolette Sheridan doing an erotic dance in her lingerie. If the movie ever makes it to HBO On Demand, I suggest you just fast-forward to that particular scene, mute the sound, and watch it in a loop. Yes, it's that friggin' hot! As for the comedy, expect your usual assortment of bland, crude, sitcom-style gags. If you can't see the punchlines to each gag coming a mile away, you might want to consider getting a cat scan. In one scene, a janitor (one of Cedric's co-workers) is interrogated by a federal agent in a restroom. The agent points a gun at him, urging him to give him some information about Cedric's character. The janitor is an aspiring rapper, and goes on a whole rant about how he wants to be shot, since he wants to be the first rapper to write his songs while in a coma. He bends over, begging the agent to shoot him in the backside. The agent eventually leaves the restroom, as the janitor keeps screaming out, ""Put a bullet in my a**! Put it in my a**! Put it in my as**!"" And--guess what--one of his fellow janitors strolls into the restroom as he continues to scream out, ""Put it in my a**!"" Unless you're a teenager who will laugh at all things scatological, you might want to consider putting a bullet in your own rear end for finding an outrageously stupid gag like that funny. My God!

Company (2002) - IMDb,"Ram Gopal Varma's latest offering 'Company' is probably one of the best Indian gangster films ever made (after Nayakan and Satya). This film is so well done that the viewers feel like they are watching real-life events. And people living in India will know that some of the events are actually inspired by real-life incidents, although the film does not admit it.
Company is the story of two friends - Malik (Ajay Devgan) and Chandu (Vivek Oberoi) - how they build up the 'Company' - Bombay underworld on a global scale and thus establish their supremacy. A small misunderstanding between them turns into a large scale mafia war. The cast in this film is great, a special mention must be made of Vivek Oberoi. The son of Suresh Oberoi (former Bollywood star) is talented and seems to have put in a lot of effort for his first film. I only hope he doesn't get type-casted in the future after such a hard-hitting role on debut. Ajay Devgan fits very well into the role of Malik, a cold blooded don who always means business. Manisha Koirala enacts the role of Malik's girlfriend pretty well and is refreshing. However, the biggest surprise of this film was Antara Mali. She has done a great job as Chandu's wife, and it only goes to show that there is no dearth of talent in the country.The narrative is well paced, and the viewer never gets bored. Some people might find the absence of songs in the film annoying, but their presence would only hamper the pace of the film. The script is well written, and some of the dialogues are really memorable - for example, when Malik says ""To forgive a friend's mistake is an even bigger mistake in the 'Company'"". The background music by Sandeep Chowta really complements the plot and he certainly deserves some credit. But more than anything, it is Ram Gopal Varma's direction that needs to be appreciated. He has proved once again that with a good story, an excellent cast and a lot of determination, one can make a memorable film and defy some of Bollywood's age old norms. A special mention must also be made of Mohanlal. He is certainly one of the best Indian actors of all time and although his Hindi dialogue-delivery in Company is quite sloppy, he deserves a lot of praise for making a good effort. His portrayal of an honest, determined cop trying to eradicate crime in Bombay (loosely based on Sivanandan, Joint Commissioner of Police, Mumbai) is very well executed.The film gives us an in-depth view into the dark world of Bombay Mafia, where only the fittest survive, and how their operations have spread on a global scale. One thing I found intriguing about this film was the role that mobile phones play, how everything can be controlled efficiently by just making one phone call, and how business deals and murders can be executed with, quite literally, just one push of a button.Bottomline:  This film is a must-watch. A landmark in Indian film-making, all thanks to Ram Gopal Varma.

Congo (1995) - IMDb,"In Congo, Charles Travis (Bruce Campbell) is testing a communication system by laser with his former fiancée Dr. Karen Ross (Laura Linney) for the TraviCom network. Charles is the son of the millionaire R.B. Travis (Joe Don Baker), who owns the TraviCom and is Karen's employer. Charles and his friend Jeffrey (Taylor Nichols) find the ruins of a lost city but are somehow killed. Meanwhile their camp is completely destroyed and then the camera is shut down by a creature. Travis discloses to Karen that his son was actually trying to find a rare blue diamond in Congo and sends her to look for him. Meanwhile, Dr. Peter Elliot (Dylan Walsh) and his assistant Richard (Grant Heslov) are testing communication with the gorilla Amy and they decide to take her back to Congo since the animal seems to miss her birthplace. However they have funding issue but the Romanian philanthropist Herkermer Homolka (Tim Curry) offers to financially assist them. In the airport, Karen provides more money and joins the expedition. In the politically unstable Africa, they meet the experienced guide Captain Munro Kelly (Ernie Hudson) that bribes Captain Wanta (Delroy Lindo) to let them go. Further, he discloses that Homolka's real intention is to find the Lost City of Zinj. Then they embark in a plane in the beginning of a dangerous adventure in Congo. Despite the negative reviews, ""Congo"" is an entertaining but outdated jungle adventure movie in the style of Tarzan, with lost city, dangerous gorillas and forgotten tribe of natives. The screenplay does not develop well the relationship among Charles Travis, his apparently estranged father R.B. Travis and Dr. Karen Ross but the film works on a rainy Saturday afternoon.

Congo (1995) - IMDb,"What can you say about a movie like ""Congo""? Well, it's silly and underdeveloped with some pretty shabby special effects but god help me, I like it.The plot is somewhat episodic as multiple different characters with wildly different motives converge on the Congo. One is a communications technician (played nicely by Lauara Linney) who is looking for her fiancé. Another is a Romanain nut case (played by the fabulous Tim Curry) who is looking for a mythical, lost diamond mine. And the last is a gorilla expert returning a talking gorilla back to her natural habitat. I swear, I'm NOT making this up.The cast as a whole is OK. Linney is appealing, Curry turns in a usual fine job, and cameos from Bruce Campbell and Joe Don Baker add to the quirky atmosphere. Special mention should go to Ernie Hudson, who's roguish charm while not as polished as Harrison Ford's, makes a great Clark Gable/Indiana Jones type-explorer.The special effects are kind of a mixed bag. The gorillas are obviously stunt-men but the hokeyness is kind of fun. The climax in the temple is also silly but still rousing. Topping all this off, the quirky Jerry Goldsmith score adds considerably to the film as a whole.Although certainly not a classic or even 100% good, ""Congo"" is a cheesy, yet entertaining jungle adventure movie and is worth seeing.",Herbest813,June/2010,5, Think Indiana Jones crossed with Jurrasic Park and add a dash of Star Wars,0,"[say, movie, like, congo, well, silly, underdevelop, pretty, shabby, special, effect, god, help, like, plot, somewhat, episodic, multiple, different, character, wildly, different, motif, converge, congo, one, communication, technician, played, nicely, lauara, linney, look, fiancé, another, romanain, nut, case, played, fabulous, tim, curry, look, mythical, lose, diamond, mine, last, gorilla, expert, return, talk, gorilla, back, natural, habitat, swear, make, cast, whole, linney, appeal, curry, turn, usual, fine, job, cameo, bruce, campbell, joe, baker, add, quirky, atmosphere, special, mention, go, ernie, hudson, roguish, charm, polished, harrison, ford, make, great, clark, jones, special, effect, kind, mixed, bag, gorilla, obviously, hokeyness, kind, fun, climax, ...]","[can, you, say, about, a movie, like, congo, well, it, is, silly and underdeveloped, with, some pretty shabby special effects, god help me, i, like, it.the plot, is, somewhat episodic, as, multiple different characters, with, wildly different motives, converge, on, the congo, is, a communications, technician, played, nicely, by, lauara linney, is looking, for, her fiancé, is, a romanain nut case, played, by, the fabulous tim curry, is looking, for, a mythical, lost, diamond mine, the last, is, a gorilla expert, returning, a talking gorilla, back, to, her natural habitat, i swear, i, am not making, this up.the cast, as, a whole, is ok, linney, is, appealing, curry turns, in, a usual fine job, cameos, from, bruce campbell and joe don baker add, to, the quirky atmosphere, special mention, should go, to, ernie, hudson, is, roguish charm, while, not as polished, as, harrison ford, s, makes, a great clark gable/indiana jones, type-explorer.the special effects, are, kind, of, mixed, bag, the gorillas, are, obviously stunt-men, the hokeyness, is kind, of, fun, the climax, ...]",-53.94026012124663,-7.1740971051341145,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,3,2,0,0,4,4,0,2,0,4,4,2,5.801801801801803,111,131,movie like congo well silly underdeveloped pretty shabby special effects god help like plot somewhat episodic multiple different characters wildly different motives converge congo communications technician played nicely lauara linney looking fiancé another romanain nut case played fabulous tim curry looking mythical lost diamond mine last gorilla expert returning talking gorilla natural habitat swear making cast whole ok linney appealing curry turns usual fine job cameos bruce campbell joe baker add quirky atmosphere special mention ernie hudson roguish charm polished harrison fords makes great clark gable indiana jones type explorer special effects kind mixed bag gorillas obviously stunt men hokeyness kind fun climax temple silly still rousing topping quirky jerry goldsmith score adds considerably film whole although certainly classic even 100 good congo cheesy yet entertaining jungle adventure movie worth seeing,0.1986291486291486,0.5817460317460318,1
Cowboy Bebop: The Movie (2001) - IMDb,"I'll try to avoid echoing other comments here and cut straight to the chase: This is not perfect, but MAN it's so close. I had some trouble with the pacing, which seemed a bit slow to me--as if they weren't quite sure how to work with a feature-length timeframe; I'm still a bit hazy on just how the villain's threat was resolved, which I'm usually not after a CB episode; and gosh, *why* isn't ""Tank!"" on the soundtrack?  Songs with words just don't cut it in a CB score. --But honestly, those seem like such small problems next to everything that's wonderful about this movie. It has all the stuff you love about Bebop the series: the brilliant, flashing action and fight sequences, the character interaction, Spike's nicotine jones =), the gorgeous cinematic visuals, and the dreamlike melancholy that underlies even the funniest moments.  The villain, his grip on the fantasy/reality divide completely erased after a genetic experiment on Titan, makes a neat counterpoint to Spike, forever haunted by his dreams of the perfect future he once believed in. Jet's protective concern for his reckless teammates was never better painted than in a scene where he blusters about how much happier he was without any of them and couldn't care less where they are, only to pounce on the phone's first ring like a worried mom on date night. There's just a *little* more of Faye's skin for the fanboys (but only a very little bit more, honest! we're not talking topless here! x my heart!), Ed has a trick-or-treat encounter that would never make it to American TV,  and even the Big Shot duo put in an appearance (despite having absolutely nothing to say). It's not intended as a wrap-up or finale to CB the series; it occurs in between episodes and should be thought of that way, as an experimental episode both different from and similar to the original sessions.

Cowboy Bebop: The Movie (2001) - IMDb,"""Well, that's a real shame. But, we're not cops and we're not from some charity organization. Sorry lady, we don't protect or serve. This is strictly business.""One word came to my mind after watching this. Unnecessary.I have been putting off watching the Cowboy Bebop movie for several years now. I'm a huge fan of the show, but I had heard and read so many mixed or negative reviews of the movie online and from friends, that I was hesitant to see it. In the end, though, I figured that any Cowboy Bebop had to be somewhat worthwhile. That turned out to be partially true, but I still find myself disappointed.To be blunt, the story was completely uninteresting. Each episode of the series was like a (good) mini-movie on its own, so I don't get why giving the creators more time to develop and tell this story, ended up producing something that wasn't nearly as engaging as any given one of the original episodes. It felt like the decision to make the movie came first, and very little effort was put into making a worthy plot to go along with it.The new characters are uniformly dull, much of the soundtrack was poor (How did THAT happen? Where's the jazz?), and the film as a whole felt disjointed, at best. I tried as hard as o could to like it all, but the most positive description I can give for my experience is ""meh"".I'll admit that it warmed my fanboy heart to see Spike, Faye, and the gang in action again. The animation was very good, and some of the action scenes were top notch. But without the great storytelling that we've all come to expect, I'd recommend this to only the most fervent Cowboy Bebop fan. You'd have much more fun in the same amount of time by just watching four of your favorite episodes of the show. ",lewiskendell7,July/2010,5, I expected more.,0,"[well, real, shame, cop, charity, organization, sorry, lady, protect, serve, strictly, business, one, word, come, mind, watch, put, watch, cowboy, bebop, movie, several, year, huge, fan, show, heard, read, many, mixed, negative, review, movie, online, friend, hesitant, see, end, though, figure, cowboy, bebop, somewhat, worthwhile, turn, partially, true, still, find, blunt, story, completely, uninteresting, episode, series, like, good, get, give, creator, time, develop, tell, story, end, produce, something, nearly, engage, give, one, original, episode, felt, like, decision, make, movie, come, first, little, effort, put, make, worthy, plot, go, along, new, character, uniformly, dull, much, soundtrack, poor, happen, jazz, film, whole, ...]","[well, is, a real shame, we, are, not cops, we, are, not, from, some charity organization, sorry lady, we, do not protect, serve, is, strictly, business.""one word, came, to, my mind, after, watching, have been putting, off, watching, the cowboy bebop movie, for, several years, now, i, am, a huge fan, of, the show, i, had heard, read so many mixed, negative reviews, of, the movie, online, from, friends, that, i, was, hesitant, to, see, it, in, the end, though, i, figured, that, any cowboy bebop, had, to, be, somewhat worthwhile, turned out, to, be, partially true, i, still find, myself, disappointed.to, be, blunt, the story, was, completely uninteresting, each episode, of, the series, was, like, good, mini-movie, on, its, own, so i, do not get, why, giving, the creators, more time, to, develop, tell, this story, ended, up, producing, something, was not nearly as engaging, ...]",-43.91898748565254,-4.246099973924274,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,3,2,0,0,4,4,0,2,0,4,4,2,5.86842105263158,114,141,well real shame cops charity organization sorry lady protect serve strictly business word came mind watching unnecessary putting watching cowboy bebop movie several years huge fan show heard read many mixed negative reviews movie online friends hesitant end though figured cowboy bebop somewhat worthwhile turned partially true still disappointed blunt story completely uninteresting episode series like good mini movie giving creators time develop story ended producing something nearly engaging given original episodes felt like decision movie came first little effort put making worthy plot along new characters uniformly dull much soundtrack poor happen jazz film whole felt disjointed best tried hard could like positive description give experience meh admit warmed fanboy heart spike faye gang action animation good action scenes top notch without great storytelling expect would recommend fervent cowboy bebop fan would much fun amount time watching favorite episodes show,0.1742768595041322,0.5219696969696969,1
Cyborg (1989) - IMDb,"Cyborg (1989) is one of my favorite Van Damme underrated Post-Apocalyptic,Science Fiction Action movie from the late 80's. The film is Very fast-paced, under 90 min., cool post apocalyptic setting, very epic, they are great villains in here, Awesome ass kicking with the knife boots, Great score, Van Damme did a awesome job showing body language/presence, and I knew I wasn't the only one who thought Van Damme had a Badass walk. Very underrated indeed. Jean-Claude Van Damme is still today, one of my favorite action stars, I absolutely love his movies from his golden years. I grew up watching Cyborg as a kid. The movie wasn't my favorite Van Damme movie. I did not watch this movie so many times on TV, like I have watched other his movie that I love. Watching countless today this flick, I fall in love with it and it become one of my favorite Van Damme movies.In the barbaric, plague-ridden wasteland of the 21st century, a beautiful half-human cyborg carries information that can save civilization. But only the strength and cunning of a lone warrior (Jean-Claude Van Damme) can deliver her --and her vital data from the clutches of the unspeakable Flesh Prates. That is the main plot about this film, that it also involves revenge and the human character played by Van Damme, which his character has a heart! I absolutely love Cyborg. Jean-Claude Van Damme did a solid job acting in this movie, which I thought was very brilliant and very fast paced. Sort of the movie reminds me on Mad Max 1 & 2, which I absolutely love those movies and Conan the Barbarian (1982) with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead role. Because Fender kills Gibson's family and Gibson goes out for a revenge. He travels in the post apocalyptic world in which a plague known as the living death cripples civilization. When Gbson (Van Damme) was tied and was hanging from the mast watching into the sky, the similar scene was used in Conan the Barbarian, even Conan was looking for the people who killed his family. That is why Cyborg reminds me on these movies, they are my favorite. As a kid I still remember seeing the VHS cover in the store of Cyborg and I was impressed. I could watch this movie countless times. I hope I could get this movie on Blu-ray someday but, that will be really hard.Considering its' low budget, it's an entertaining flick. Great fights, cool villain, great scenes (like the 'crucified scene')... I seriously love Van Damme's kicks with boot knife. I love when Van Damme yells FENDEEEERRR... The final fight between Gibson and Fender was absolutely epic. The similar scene was also in Universal Soldier. I think cyborg is a bad ass film from Cannon Group. It is a shame that they can't make any movies today anymore.I can say something about the actors and the whole cast crew: Beside loving Van Damme in here: actress Deborah Richter as Nady Simmons, the girl who helps Van Damme, killing Fender (Vincent Klyn) and finding Pearl (Dayle Haddon) a female cyborg caring a cure, did a terrific job, she was very awesome gorgeous and very beautiful sexy. Haley Peterson as Haley the sister of murdered family by Fender, was extremely gorgeous and fast feisty sexy babe on the screen ever. Vincent Klyn as Fender the leader of pirates, was a real bad ass villain ever. I wish they would make movies like this today! About the sequels I don't care they all suck ass! Once I watch Cyborg 2 with Angelina Jolie and Elias Koteas and that movie sucked! Director Albert Pyun made a great job as the director. He directed terrific the angles of the picture.Cyborg is a 1989 science fiction post apocalyptic film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as a mercenary who while traveling the wasteland of what was the Eastern United States finds himself protecting a woman who could hold the key to restoring humanity. The film was directed by Albert Pyun. More action and high flying kicks, nothing new, except for a fun plot...to this day I still choose this movie over any other pointless movies that lead to nowhere. This movie get's a perfect 10 by me.

Cyborg (1989) - IMDb,"I'm not an action movie guy at the best of times but I consider the 80's/90's to be the best time for the genre. Sure many were cheesy as hell but they often had a certain charm about them, this doesn't.Couple of interesting facts about Cyborg. First of all it began a franchise, many people don't realise as they aren't simply Cyborg 1, 2, 3 etc they merged into another film series and they're incredibly still going at time of writing.Second Cyborg was originally supposed to be Masters of the Universe 2! That's right this was meant to be a sequel to the Dolph Lungren He-Man film but after it tanked at the box office they changed their minds. However a script was written, the production had already been prepped so they decided to make the movie anyway, changing some characters and make it R rated.It tells the story of a wanderer in a post apocalyptic world, lost and alone after the death of his family he swears vengeance and etc etc etc. Very cliched cheesy stuff with a cyborg related side story that ultimately didn't even need to exist and contributes nothing to the movie.What makes Cyborg really stand out is the acting, it's atrocious. I don't just mean Van Damme I mean everyone across the board. It has some of the most consistently awful acting I've possibly ever seen, Deborah Richter is adorable but can't act in the slightest and don't even get me started on the movies antagonist.I hope the franchise get's better as I'll be binging it, I'll just say this is one for diehard action fanatics alone.The Good:I liked bit where the screen went black and all the peoples names appearedThe Bad:Clean sweep of awful actors/actressesCliched to hell and backThings I Learnt From This Movie:Bad guys don't brush their teethActing ability is optional when casting for action movies",Platypuschow28,October/2018,3, Cyborg: My brain hates me right now,0,"[action, movie, guy, best, time, consider, best, time, genre, sure, many, cheesy, hell, often, certain, charm, interest, fact, cyborg, first, begin, franchise, many, people, realise, simply, cyborg, etc, merge, another, film, series, incredibly, still, go, time, cyborg, originally, suppose, master, universe, right, meant, sequel, dolph, lungren, film, tanked, box, office, change, mind, however, script, write, production, already, prepped, decide, make, movie, anyway, change, character, make, tell, story, wanderer, post, apocalyptic, world, lose, alone, death, family, swears, vengeance, etc, etc, etc, cliched, cheesy, stuff, cyborg, related, side, story, ultimately, even, need, exist, contributes, nothing, make, cyborg, really, stand, act, atrocious, mean, ...]","[i, am, not, an action movie guy, at, best, of, times but i consider, to, be, the best time, for, the genre, sure many, were, cheesy, as, hell but they, often had, a certain charm, about, them, does, not.couple, of, interesting facts, about, cyborg, first, of, all it, began, a franchise, many people, do, not realise, as, they, are, not simply cyborg, they, merged, into, another film series, they, are incredibly still going, at, time, of, writing.second cyborg, was originally supposed, to, be, masters, of, the universe, is right, was meant, to, be, a sequel, to, the dolph, lungren, he-man film, after, it, tanked, at, the box office they, changed, their minds, however, a script, was written, the production, had already been prepped, so, they, decided, to, make, the movie, anyway, changing, some characters, make, it, are, rated.it, tells, the story, of, a wanderer, in, a post, apocalyptic world, lost, alone, after, ...]",-10.088253190021804,-4.9368350445340905,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,5.7819548872180455,133,169,action movie guy best times consider 80s 90s best time genre sure many cheesy hell often certain charm couple interesting facts cyborg first began franchise many people realise simply cyborg 1 2 3 etc merged another film series incredibly still going time writing second cyborg originally supposed masters universe 2 right meant sequel dolph lungren man film tanked box office changed minds however script written production already prepped decided movie anyway changing characters r rated tells story wanderer post apocalyptic world lost alone death family swears vengeance etc etc etc cliched cheesy stuff cyborg related side story ultimately even need exist contributes nothing movie makes cyborg really stand acting atrocious mean van damme mean everyone across board consistently awful acting possibly ever seen deborah richter adorable act slightest even started movies antagonist hope franchise gets better binging diehard action fanatics alone good liked bit screen went black peoples names appearedthe bad clean sweep awful actors actressescliched hell backthings learnt movie bad guys brush teethacting ability optional casting action movies,0.08918918918918921,0.5696803946803948,1
DOA: Dead or Alive (2006) - IMDb,"Dead or Alive is a film that is so exploitative and atrociously bad, that somehow it ended up being a whole lot of fun. However to view this as a fun film, it must be viewed as intended: With brain switched off, and ol' Mr McDong taking control of your functions for 80 minutes. Yes, this may be a film with a predominantly female cast, but ladies need not turn up to watch this, cause they probably won't enjoy it, unless their sexual barometer is registering the opposite end from ""hetero."" This film is total gratuity in every regard, from the scantily clad, sexy ladies, to the barrage of testosterone pumping action. This is hot chicks doing high kicks! So with that, and having this the pre-conceived idea when I bought my ticket, I knew I'd enjoy it. Hell the film was marketed right. It's about a video game and has the subtlety of said game, which is in the button bashing, short attention span of the games spectrum. It's a simple movie for a simple movie going experience. IF anyone goes into this film and comes out having not enjoyed it, then they SHOULD have known better! I think only those who want to see this kind of film, who are in the mood, will watch, and they'll get a kick out of it like me. Critics will despise it cause it represents a film they have to watch, but probably don't want to.So DOA is essentially a non-interactive video game, an FMV if you will. It's got an awful script, mediocre acting, and all the efforts of the filmmakers have gone into perfectly capturing, glistening, bouncing boobies amongst the martial arts mayhem. The plot essentially is nothing more than little set-ups to all the fights, taking place at a secret fighting tournament set up by Eric Roberts, in grade-A scenery chewing mode. Roberts to me is a tragic waste of talent, who in the early 80's looked a great prospect and to some, me included, has more talent than his over-rated sister Julia (who now of course takes all the plaudits). Roberts is consigned to doing DTV movies now, or TV movies and on the rare occasion he appears back in the multiplexes, it's in another B-movie that usually is awful. However at least Eric is enjoying himself here, relishing his return (somewhat) to the limelight. or to put it another way, to remind people Julia wasn't an only child! The rest of the main cast, who register any interest, are the hot ladies. There's the rather bizarre, yet strikingly attractive looking Devon Aoki and then there's also Holly Valance, Sarah Carter and Natassia Malthe too. However it's Jaime Pressley who steals the show, not only with her performance, that delivers the most laughs (intentional ones that is), but also she has a bod to die for and considering some stiff competition from Valances sculpted physique in particular, that's no mean feat.Overall though this film will go down as a classic bad movie. The filmmakers never intended making anything beyond what they deliver. This is bad, it's cheesy and it's forgettable. But it's outrageously fun while it lasts and it most certainly requires the wearing of loose fitting underwear to allow for Sgt Schlong to stand to attention every now and again. I feel guilty having enjoyed it, but I had a good idea of the film that would be delivered and it was delivered as I imagined. ***",supertom-319,September/2006,7, Good fun if you're in the right mood!,1,"[dead, alive, film, exploitative, atrociously, bad, somehow, end, whole, lot, fun, however, view, fun, film, must, view, intend, brain, switch, ol, mr, mcdong, take, control, function, minute, yes, may, film, predominantly, female, cast, lady, need, turn, watch, probably, enjoy, unless, sexual, barometer, register, opposite, end, hetero, film, total, gratuity, every, regard, scantily, clad, sexy, lady, barrage, testosterone, pump, action, hot, chick, high, kick, idea, bought, ticket, knew, would, enjoy, hell, film, market, right, video, game, subtlety, say, game, button, bashing, short, attention, span, game, spectrum, simple, movie, simple, movie, go, experience, anyone, go, film, come, enjoy, know, better, think, want, ...]","[dead, alive, is, a film, is, so exploitative and atrociously bad, that, somehow, it, ended, up, being, a whole lot, of, fun, however, to, view, this as, a fun film, it, must be viewed, as, intended, with, brain, switched, off, ol, mr mcdong, taking, control, of, your functions, for, 80 minutes, may be, a film, with, a predominantly female cast, ladies, need not turn up, to, watch, because, they, probably will not enjoy, it, unless, their sexual barometer, is registering, the opposite end, from, hetero, this film, is, total gratuity, in, every regard, from, scantily clad, sexy ladies, to, the barrage, of, testosterone, pumping, action, is, hot chicks, doing, high kicks, so, with that, having, this the pre-conceived idea, when, i, bought, my ticket, i, knew, i, would enjoy, it, hell, the film, was marketed, right, it, is, about, a video game, has, the subtlety, said, game, is, in, the button, ...]",140.95086937091958,-15.384817895219008,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,0,3,3,1,1,4,1,1,1,0,5,5,0,5.7857142857142865,224,290,dead alive film exploitative atrociously bad somehow ended whole lot fun however view fun film must viewed intended brain switched ol mcdong taking control functions 80 minutes yes may film predominantly female cast ladies need turn watch cause probably enjoy unless sexual barometer registering opposite end hetero film total gratuity every regard scantily clad sexy ladies barrage testosterone pumping action hot chicks high kicks pre conceived idea bought ticket knew would enjoy hell film marketed right video game subtlety said game button bashing short attention span games spectrum simple movie simple movie going experience anyone goes film comes enjoyed known better think want kind film mood watch kick like critics despise cause represents film watch probably want doa essentially non interactive video game fmv got awful script mediocre acting efforts filmmakers gone perfectly capturing glistening bouncing boobies amongst martial arts mayhem plot essentially nothing little set ups fights taking place secret fighting tournament set eric roberts grade scenery chewing mode roberts tragic waste talent early 80s looked great prospect included talent rated sister julia course takes plaudits roberts consigned dtv movies tv movies rare occasion appears multiplexes another b movie usually awful however least eric enjoying relishing return somewhat limelight put another way remind people julia child rest main cast register interest hot ladies rather bizarre yet strikingly attractive looking devon aoki holly valance sarah carter natassia malthe however jaime pressley steals show performance delivers laughs intentional ones bod die considering stiff competition valances sculpted physique particular mean feat overall though film classic bad movie filmmakers never intended making anything beyond deliver bad cheesy forgettable outrageously fun lasts certainly requires wearing loose fitting underwear allow sgt schlong stand attention every feel guilty enjoyed good idea film would delivered delivered imagined,0.026856112637362657,0.5203358230311357,1
DOA: Dead or Alive (2006) - IMDb,"With its one dimensional characters and convoluted story, dead or alive was never really the best game to bring to the big screen . But nevertheless thanks to cory yune and a dubious ensemble cast, we now have a dead or alive movie. But is it any better than the corny trailers suggests ? The answer is NO .Like the games its based on there's plenty of scantily clad babes and over the top action but thats all there is. There's no sense of suspense, interesting characters or successful attempts at intentional humour- just over edited fights mixed with a healthy portion of T&A.Will the fans like it ? I can safely bet that once again the answer is no. Much like 94's street fighter movie, the characters are brought to life through a horribly mismatched cast decked out in cheesy cosplay outfits- only the most die-hard fans will be completely happy with this one.DOA isn't completely terrible.

Dangal (2016) - IMDb,"Mahavir Singh Phogat teaches his two daughters to be international wrestling players of India! This is a simple and impressive story. And they finally defeat UK on the wrestling match. 
I think this is India's 'Yip Man'! This kind of nationalism is healthy and is beneficial to all audiences without background considerations. The film length is also accurate. Growing courses of protagonists need 160 minutes. And emotional responses to their tragic mistakes are well described by the talented actors in detail. Audiences can fully engage in this film. 
A lot of Asian audiences have bias against Indian films that their films are just dances and songs for two hours or more, however there is the perfect construction of story with minimalist use of songs and musics. 
This quality is higher than any Japanese films of today! Indian filmmakers should keep this high quality of film content! It is competitive to Hollywood films. At the end of the film, it is full of enlightenment, the most important thing in life is not 'thing' but it is a human relationship with emotion. If you are true to your families' goodness and emotion, you'll find the best solution of your problem. Even though you fail in this way, your family relationship will only be enhanced as the result of your effort and sincereness. This what this film tells you!

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) - IMDb,"While this film was a little slow it delves into the heart of an issue that has plagued us for centuries: why do we fight each other and why do we go out of our way to kill each other. While this film involves the beginning of a war between humans and apes, this war could represent any war between two clans or factions, with the difference being ideological, cultural, or even as pathetic as the colour of one's skin. It is clear that the hostilities that arise come down to differences that are pretty much only skin deep, and that is that one side are apes and the other side is human.As I watched this film though it made me think about the wars that are brewing, or raging, around the globe, and how many of these wars begin through misunderstandings and outright lies. Among the apes we are being told that humans are barbaric and dangerous, and that they cannot be trusted. Among the humans we are told that the apes are responsible for the virus that devastated humanity. Then there is the manipulation of facts and the propaganda that begins the war, as well as the struggle within the factions, between those who see war as being pointless, as well as those who believe that it is necessary, because those who do not go to war are weak and will end up being overthrown.There is also the misunderstandings and the distrust between the two sides, for while they are told to discard their weapons, there is one that always has to ignore the request due to the fear that by discarding their weapons they open themselves up to being attacked and being defenceless. Of course there are those who are always looking for a peaceful solution, trying to work together, however the peaceful ones are always being undermined by the war mongers, who for some reason seem to have the loudest voices.Sometimes I wonder whether Hollywood actually supports the warmongers in power, or whether they are closer to the left as the right claim they are. For me it is the Hollywood dichotomy in that they have aspects of both the left and the right within their culture. Obviously there is the lose morals of many of the characters, and of course the idea that seeking revenge for being wronged is actually okay (which seems to form the basis of many an action movie). In this film it is the question of war, and the fact that when it comes to war, those who cry for war, and those who manipulate the truth to fuel the passions of the masses, are those that then to come out on top, and those who advocate for peace are seen as weak, and in some cases, unpatriotic.",david-sarkies19,July/2014,8, The philosophy of why we go to war,1,"[film, little, slow, delf, heart, issue, plague, us, century, fight, go, way, kill, film, involves, begin, war, human, ape, war, could, represent, war, two, clan, faction, difference, ideological, cultural, even, pathetic, colour, one, skin, clear, hostility, arise, come, difference, pretty, much, skin, deep, one, side, ape, side, watch, film, though, make, think, war, brewing, rag, around, globe, many, war, begin, misunderstanding, outright, lie, among, ape, told, human, barbaric, dangerous, trust, among, human, told, ape, responsible, virus, devastate, humanity, manipulation, fact, propaganda, begin, war, well, struggle, within, faction, see, war, pointless, well, believe, necessary, go, war, weak, end, also, misunderstanding, distrust, ...]","[while, this film, was, a little slow it, delves, into, the heart, of, an issue, has plagued, us, for, centuries, why, do, we, fight, other, why, do, we, go, out of, our way, to, kill, each other, while, this film, involves, the beginning, of, a war, between, humans and apes, this war, could represent, any war, between, two clans, factions, with, the difference, being, ideological, cultural, even as pathetic, as, the colour, of, skin, it, is, clear, that, the hostilities, that, arise come, down, to, differences, are, pretty much only skin, deep, is, that, one side, are, apes and the other side, is, human.as, i watched, this film, though, it, made, me, think, about, the wars, are, brewing, raging, around, the globe, how, many, of, these wars, begin, through, misunderstandings and outright lies, among, the apes we, are being told, that, humans, are, barbaric and dangerous, that, ...]",6.349061126987059,0.9614872232905124,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,6.014598540145985,137,186,film little slow delves heart issue plagued us centuries fight way kill film involves beginning war humans apes war could represent war clans factions difference ideological cultural even pathetic colour ones skin clear hostilities arise differences pretty much skin deep side apes side human watched film though made think wars brewing raging around globe many wars begin misunderstandings outright lies among apes told humans barbaric dangerous trusted among humans told apes responsible virus devastated humanity manipulation facts propaganda begins war well struggle within factions war pointless well believe necessary war weak end overthrown misunderstandings distrust sides told discard weapons always ignore request due fear discarding weapons open attacked defenceless course always looking peaceful solution trying work together however peaceful ones always undermined war mongers reason seem loudest voices sometimes wonder whether hollywood actually supports warmongers power whether closer left right claim hollywood dichotomy aspects left right within culture obviously lose morals many characters course idea seeking revenge wronged actually okay seems form basis many action movie film question war fact comes war cry war manipulate truth fuel passions masses top advocate peace seen weak cases unpatriotic,0.03777901785714286,0.45405505952380953,1
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) - IMDb,"I wonder why this movie has such a high rating. This tricked me into going to the theater to watch it. So, a virus kills most people on earth. At the same time the apes evolve and become intelligent. Of course this has to happen over generations and not just by the passing of time in the same individuals, but let's say it happened. And so the plot holes begin:All the human survivors are gathered in one building in the middle of San Fransisco. What are they eating? Do they grow the earth? -NoDo they raise livestock? -No.Are they near a spring or well to have fresh running water? -No.Are they dressed in animal skins or primitive hand made clothes? -No, they use 10 or 15 year old clothes and look great.So all these people together produce a lot of waste, what happens to it? -Nothing, probably use the sewers which are capable of functioning forever without any maintenance of any kind. Probably the writers imagined the survivors using the toilet and flushing and the water appearing magically from taps, showers and toilets...What do they really need? -Power to charge the i-Pad to see the old photos. Of course they cannot go to the nearest refinery or gas depot and fill a tanker truck, but they risk their lives going to the mountains against angry intelligent apes, because the radio uses a lot of power and the nuclear plant doesn't work any more. Makes perfect sense.And of course when they repair the dam the power magically transfers to the city, tenths of miles far, because of course poles do not fall down and cables don't cut after 10 or 15 years without maintenance just like the sewers.The apes can all talk, and the villain ape has English accent. They prefer to use sign language though because a language which is useless in the dark or even just when the other person is not looking at you is superior to a spoken language.And which is the best way to test guns? By shooting them, because 10-15 years old or older guns with out any kind of maintenance never blow up in your face when you try to shoot them.And then the apes learn to use the guns and they shoot literally thousands of rounds without ever reloading. No need to reload in wonderland... I, personally had one year of training for my military service, and I am still not sure how to use a weapon I was not trained with but hey I m not an ape!A lot more stupidity from the writers and finally, the human warns the apes that the army is coming to wipe them out, but the ape leader which through the entire movie is depicted as intelligent, moderate and cautious does not order to hide in the woods. Instead he stays in the city waiting for the army.The characters are a joke, especially the bad guys, and generally don't spend any money on this if you are over 16 years old.

Deadpool (2016) - IMDb,"At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch).

Deadpool (2016) - IMDb,"One word describes this movie - pointless.Wow, this film was incredibly boring. People are hyping this movie over nothing. The story is so simple and boring. It didn't even feel like I was watching a thought-provoking movie, more like a short and simple TV series with an unfunny, forced and pointless main character on his pointless adventure to fight forgettable and pointless villains. The X-men were pointless as well. They didn't add anything to the story. They only assisted Deadpool with fighting the villains when their original goal was to have deadpool work for them. They happily accepted Deadpool as a murderer and wished a murderer to join them. The only okay point in this movie was the action. However, the action still could have been better as it felt very rushed at times, and at other times very short and at times it lacked in good choreography. It didn't feel intense at all, more like you know the villains are going to fail very easily.I also hated the use of childish words being used quite a bit to explain the purpose of the weapon x program e.g. ""superheroes"", ""superslaves"" etc. What are these villains even doing? There was nothing deep and meaningful behind the program and these villains. The story was lacking in too many ways. The world felt very empty and hollow.Looks like people are very cheap and easy nowadays that they would enjoy anything just because it is r-rated. That is the truth, that is the only reason this movie has such a high rating because of the use of ""F"" words and other vulgar words, it has sex and nude scenes and it is gory and violent.

Deadpool 2 (2018) - IMDb,"It just saddens me that this film is so highly rated. There were parts of it I enjoyed but not that many. The tie-in with the X-men world worked for a while because of deadpool's looser sense of ethics, and the reduced circumstances of his - and the kid's incarceration in mutant prison almost makes him vulnerable enough to care about, but none of that lasts, and for the majority - and after those events - remainder of the film, we find ourselves in the presence of someone who not only won't die, but - and of course it is his trade-mark - won't shut up. All superheroes are effectively immortal, but there is something about deadpool's unkillability that really destroys any tension in this movie, and unfortunately it is all done quite deliberately. In most superhero movies we know that that the (super)hero must survive but somehow also worry about them. With deadpool though everything is an in-joke, and that includes the fact that superheroes - deadpool at least - are indestructable, and the movie plays with that endlessly. There is at least one funny scene that arises out of this (consequent to his meeting the monster in the prison basement) but for the most part it simply means we don't care about what happens in the way that we normally would and since the writers appear to anticipate this we are treated instead to endless knowing jokes about his desire to die. The intention seems to be to try to make deadpool into some kind of existentially tragic figure - but unlike say groundhog day, where unkillability becomes a metaphor for sameness of every day, the writers completely fail in this respect. Deadpool's loss (of a loved one) and motivation never seem real, and when he somehow finds a mission in the redemption of one of the characters in the movie it just doesn't seem like something he'd actually do. 
 
There's also the politics of the film. Leaving aside the PC aspect (which is pretty much universal these days) there's also something disturbing about the hate figures in the film. The people who run the 'ophanage' in the fim are thinly disguised religious bigots, and not only the main 'preacher' like head of the institution but all of its staff - who are likened to paedo philes - are simply despatched as token 'haters'. Given the controversies surrounding some of the people who made the x-men films themselves there is something slightly ironic about this - people who live in glass cages shouldn't ....etc.. That's not to say the mutant hating bigots aren't to be faulted, but that we shoiuld perhaps be a little wary about taking our morality from anything as ethically warped as deadpool, a man who though he can't be killed or effectively injured despatches legions of bad guys more in offence than defence, and typically in nasty and fundamentally unfair ways. In fact at times, particularly at the beginning, deadpool as a superhero feels like the cinematic version of shooting, stabbing, hacking and decapitating fish in a barrel.

Delhi Belly (2011) - IMDb,"Humor is relative. What's humorous to me might not be funny to you and while you laugh on something, I might not laugh on it. Humor is also circumstantial and gets rusty out of the context. However, there is some humor which is universal and is acceptable to everyone. If we apply the same theory on modern Hindi films, Andaz Apna Apna and Munna Bhai series might be the only films to go in universally accepted humor category. Some other humor examples that worked on the box office but were not universally accepted are Singh is King, Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani, Phir Hera Pheri, Ready, Dhamaal and Golmaal etc. Then there is another kind of humor which does not go well with the masses but has its own cult following like that of Wesa Bhi Hota Hai Part II, Mithya, Bheja Fry etc. Delhi Belly (DB) is somewhere in between the universally accepted form of humor and the subtle cult following kind of humor. Through DB and other such efforts, Hindi cinema is coming out of romantic comedies and running around the trees.To start with, the film is hilarious. It leaves you with one laugh riot after another and does not give you a chance to fully recover from the previous one before sending you through another piece of joviality. It's mostly tongue in cheek humor but at times goes very physical as well. What works in favor of the film is its dialogues and wonderful acting even though the story does not have ground breaking stuff to offer. DB could very easily go as the best casting of the year 2011, especially with the kind of role given to Vijay Raaz. Another thing that goes in favor of DB is its short duration and fast pace.Abhinay Deo, in his second directorial outing after a mildly interesting and mildly painful Game, has made sure that he doesn't go wrong anywhere even if he does not create a masterpiece. He has focused on technical side more to make sure that the editing is crisp and background score goes in line with the action despite no songs. Also, with an open ended climax, he seems to have left a door open for a sequel. Nonetheless, it's more of an actors' film rather than a director's film and the actors have handled their responsibility with utmost satisfaction of the director. Nobody goes overboard in humor and specially the sidekicks stick to their jobs and cinematography is as per the need. The biggest compliment that I can give DB is that it has made Shehnaz Treasurywala look bearable.The lead trio, which has a distant similarity to the trio of The Hangover, has carried the film well on its shoulders. Imran Khan has done a very good job. This is his best performance since his debut. He looks in control and has a much improved dialogue delivery and comic timing after two lowly performances in Break Ke Baad and I Hate Luv Storys. Kunal Roy Kapoor is a welcome addition to the comic brigade. Vir Das is fantastic. A highly underrated actor, I must say. If someone needs more exposure for his talent, that's got to be Vir Das. The debutant Poorna Jagganathan surprises. She might not be the best looking new comer, but she surely is a good performer. The film, however, in my opinion, belongs to Vijay Raaz. He is in terrific form and outdoes himself. We all know what a brilliant actor he is but here he takes charge and delivers an outstanding performance as the villain. His scenes with Vladimir in the hotel and with the trio in their apartment are to die for. It's criminal to see so less of Vijay in recent times. Aamir Khan also appears at the end for an item number but that's after the film has left its mark.There are two reasons why DB might not work with masses even though it has a release of 1400 prints which is huge. The first barrier is the language. 95% of the film is in English. The last film with such high level of English in it was Kites and it was a box office disaster, though from a different genre. The other issue is also the language but here I mean the profanity in it. Yes, it's an adult movie and has an A certificate but the explicitness that DB has, I have never seen in Hindi cinema before. In that department, it can actually put Hollywood to shame. It's that openness though, that makes DB worth watching again.To conclude, DB is worth a watch. Actually a lot more than worth a watch but you have to have an appetite for a certain kind of humor to watch it repeatedly. Also, be careful who you are accompanying when you go to watch it and what's your level of frankness with the people you are watching it with. Definitely, not a movie to watch with your mother-in-law or your 12 year old niece.",Saayer30,June/2011,8, DELHI BELLY (Movie Review),1,"[humor, relative, humorous, might, funny, laugh, something, might, laugh, humor, also, circumstantial, get, rusty, context, however, humor, universal, acceptable, everyone, apply, theory, modern, hindi, film, andaz, apna, apna, munna, bhai, series, might, film, go, universally, accept, humor, category, humor, example, work, box, office, universally, accept, singh, king, ajab, prem, ki, ghazab, kahani, phir, hera, pheri, ready, dhamaal, golmaal, etc, another, kind, humor, go, well, mass, cult, follow, like, wesa, bhi, hota, hai, part, ii, mithya, bheja, fry, etc, delhi, belly, db, somewhere, universally, accept, form, humor, subtle, cult, follow, kind, humor, db, effort, hindi, cinema, come, romantic, comedy, run, around, ...]","[humor, is, relative, is, humorous, to, me, might not be, funny, to, you, while, you, laugh, on, something, i, might, not, laugh, on, it, humor, is, also circumstantial, gets, rusty, out of, the context, however, is, some humor, is, universal, is, acceptable, to, everyone, if, we, apply, the same theory, on, modern hindi films, andaz apna apna and munna bhai series, might be, the only films, to, go, in, universally accepted, humor category, some other humor examples, worked, on, the box office, were not universally accepted are, singh, is king, ajab prem ki ghazab kahani, phir hera pheri, ready, dhamaal and golmaal, then, is, another kind, of, humor, does not go, well, with, the masses, has, its own cult, following, like that of, wesa bhi hota hai part ii, mithya, bheja fry, delhi belly, db, is, somewhere, in between, universally accepted, form, of, humor and the subtle cult, following, kind, of, humor, through, db and other such efforts, hindi cinema, is coming, out of, romantic comedies, running, around, ...]",287.7667869198466,-8.307753601161616,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,1,2,1,4,2,3,1,0,3,2,0,5.869127516778524,298,417,humor relative humorous might funny laugh something might laugh humor circumstantial gets rusty context however humor universal acceptable everyone apply theory modern hindi films andaz apna apna munna bhai series might films universally accepted humor category humor examples worked box office universally accepted singh king ajab prem ki ghazab kahani phir hera pheri ready dhamaal golmaal etc another kind humor well masses cult following like wesa bhi hota hai part ii mithya bheja fry etc delhi belly db somewhere universally accepted form humor subtle cult following kind humor db efforts hindi cinema coming romantic comedies running around trees start film hilarious leaves laugh riot another give chance fully recover previous sending another piece joviality mostly tongue cheek humor times goes physical well works favor film dialogues wonderful acting even though story ground breaking stuff offer db could easily best casting year 2011 especially kind role given vijay raaz another thing goes favor db short duration fast pace abhinay deo second directorial outing mildly interesting mildly painful game made sure wrong anywhere even create masterpiece focused technical side sure editing crisp background score goes line action despite songs open ended climax seems left door open sequel nonetheless actors film rather directors film actors handled responsibility utmost satisfaction director nobody goes overboard humor specially sidekicks stick jobs cinematography per need biggest compliment give db made shehnaz treasurywala look bearable lead trio distant similarity trio hangover carried film well shoulders imran khan done good job best performance since debut looks control much improved dialogue delivery comic timing lowly performances break ke baad hate luv storys kunal roy kapoor welcome addition comic brigade vir das fantastic highly underrated actor must someone needs exposure talent got vir das debutant poorna jagganathan surprises might best looking new comer surely good performer film however opinion belongs vijay raaz terrific form outdoes know brilliant actor takes charge delivers outstanding performance villain scenes vladimir hotel trio apartment die criminal less vijay recent times aamir khan appears end item number film left mark reasons db might work masses even though release 1400 prints huge first barrier language 95 film english last film high level english kites box office disaster though different genre issue language mean profanity yes adult movie certificate explicitness db never seen hindi cinema department actually put hollywood shame openness though makes db worth watching conclude db worth watch actually lot worth watch appetite certain kind humor watch repeatedly careful accompanying watch level frankness people watching definitely movie watch mother law 12 year old niece,0.1825135607364523,0.43506671708478944,1

Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! (2015) - IMDb,"The movie left a lot to be desired.Frankly did the story even need to exist?? So you have a chemist whose formula (however absurd) you want to steal and dispose of him. Why not run him down in a car accident?? It seems everything is written conviniently just for Byomkesh to come in. This is bad writing definitely. Also it does not make any sense why the missinh chemist needs to be proved as a blackmailer....who is gaining out this?? Why not stay mum and just let Byomkesh bang his head against dead clues. I have never seen a detective film where the sleuth has it so easy with the villains voluntarily providing clues at every turn. But the most irritating point was the lack of research that has gone into plotting of the 'global' conspiracy. Even if we accept an Indian rising to be a Chinese drug baron the climax and villain's plan seem so silly that it completely robbed me of the little pleasure I was getting earlier.First of all. the Japanese plan to invade and free Calcutta is so downright silly that it is imcomprehendable how it is really passed of as a serious plan in the film.Nobody attacks in submarines, its just not possible to carry an attack force like that. Maybe the writers could have thought of about a commando raid, and not a full scale attack. But then that would not have served the basic plot.Now if its an invasion, somehow, then its a major initiative. Somehow accepting that ships are carrying Japanese soldiers and coming undetected (how?) to Calcutta shores, are these suddenly to be dropped on account of just ONE air-raid siren?? In any case the Japanese possibly would have carried out a diversionary air-attack to divert attention..in that case they would have obviously faced multiple air-raid sirens. And again, while we see stray bombings all through the film, why on that very day there are no diversionary air attacks?? And, if the attack is imminent, will the two main guys on that very night sit with Byomkesh and chat?? For what?? And suppose all these happens and Japanese do take Calcutta, how it helps at all in the middle of a war?? Does fall of a city immediately make bengal free?? How does that free Bengal defend itself against a counter-attack from the rest of the British troops?? Why will the Chinese drug barons 'invest' in so shaky an affair. How will that state evolve into a drug capital of the world in the middle of a world war?? All these need not have to be detailed out, as films do have gaps. But here, the ENTIRE climax and defeat of a global conspiracy, nay a near equivalent of a war-time invasion is thwarted by ONE air-raid signal !!! This thought is so laughable that it beats me how this gibberish was passed in the script meetings. This looks like extreme poor research and almost zero knowledge about war against which the entire movie is plotted.All these also leave aside the fact that in 1943 it was actually the British who were the main villains in India...planning the genocide known as Bengal Famine which ended up killing around 4 million Bengalis. Its sad that a bengali director disregards this fact and makes the British the saviours here.But the history apart, the thinness of the plot and the sheer absurdity of the climax is so mindblowing that all good things that have passed before pale into insignificance.",freakyshower9,April/2015,2, A good attempt that goes overboard and spoils everything,0,"[movie, left, lot, story, even, need, exist, chemist, whose, formula, however, absurd, want, steal, dispose, run, car, accident, seems, everything, write, conviniently, byomkesh, come, bad, write, definitely, also, make, sense, missinh, chemist, need, prove, blackmailer, gain, stay, mum, let, byomkesh, bang, head, dead, clue, never, see, detective, film, sleuth, easy, villain, voluntarily, provide, clue, every, turn, irritate, point, lack, research, go, plot, conspiracy, even, accept, indian, rise, chinese, drug, baron, climax, villain, plan, seem, silly, completely, robbed, little, pleasure, get, japanese, plan, invade, free, calcutta, downright, silly, imcomprehendable, really, pass, serious, plan, attack, submarine, possible, carry, attack, force, like, maybe, ...]","[the movie, left, a lot, to, be desired.frankly did, the story, even need, to, exist, so, you, have, a chemist, formula, however absurd, you, want, to, steal, dispose, of, him, why, not run, him, down, in, a car accident, it, seems, everything, is written, conviniently just, for, byomkesh, to, come, in, is, bad writing, definitely, also, it, does not make, any sense, why, the missinh chemist, needs, to, be proved, as, is gaining, this, why, not stay, mum, just let, byomkesh, bang, his head, against, dead clues, i, have never seen, a detective film, where, the sleuth, has, it, so easy, with, the villains, voluntarily providing, clues, at, turn, the most irritating point, was, the lack, of, research, has gone, into, plotting, of, ', global, conspiracy, even if, we, accept, an indian, rising, to, be, a chinese drug, baron, the climax, villain, plan seem, ...]",124.44028559609345,-4.644122393106585,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,1,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.907766990291263,206,282,movie left lot desired frankly story even need exist chemist whose formula however absurd want steal dispose run car accident seems everything written conviniently byomkesh bad writing definitely sense missinh chemist needs proved blackmailer gaining stay mum let byomkesh bang head dead clues never seen detective film sleuth easy villains voluntarily providing clues every turn irritating point lack research gone plotting global conspiracy even accept indian rising chinese drug baron climax villains plan seem silly completely robbed little pleasure getting earlier first japanese plan invade free calcutta downright silly imcomprehendable really passed serious plan film nobody attacks submarines possible carry attack force like maybe writers could thought commando raid full scale attack would served basic plot invasion somehow major initiative somehow accepting ships carrying japanese soldiers coming undetected calcutta shores suddenly dropped account air raid siren case japanese possibly would carried diversionary air attack divert attention case would obviously faced multiple air raid sirens stray bombings film day diversionary air attacks attack imminent main guys night sit byomkesh chat suppose happens japanese take calcutta helps middle war fall city immediately bengal free free bengal defend counter attack rest british troops chinese drug barons invest shaky affair state evolve drug capital world middle world war need detailed films gaps entire climax defeat global conspiracy nay near equivalent war time invasion thwarted air raid signal thought laughable beats gibberish passed script meetings looks like extreme poor research almost knowledge war entire movie plotted leave aside fact 1943 actually british main villains india planning genocide known bengal famine ended killing around 4 million bengalis sad bengali director disregards fact makes british saviours history apart thinness plot sheer absurdity climax mindblowing good things passed pale insignificance,-0.023773584905660367,0.4494654088050315,0
Die Hard (1988) - IMDb,"Die Hard (1988) the first action film is by far one of the greatest best action movies of all time from the 80's till this day hands down. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! I love it so damn much and I have fun watching it so much. I have to talk about this movie: It is one man army fighting against a team of terrorists with automatic weapons and plastic explosives. Bruce Willis performance was excellent in this movie John McClane is his best role ever. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! It's stay in my heart forever. To me it felt this film realistic and it makes you think that you are alone trapped in a building against bunch of terrorists what will you do? This film has heart and soul. A lot of movies have try to do that premise since, but no movie has nail it like ""Die Hard."" This is a modern day action film of the action genre. I watch this film as a teenager I even watch it with my mom it was ultimate thrill ride. I love everyone in here all the characters and the lead character. I love that McClane is alone he has no help, all telephones doesn't work he is barefoot with his gun and the only help has is from Sgt. Al Powell down there who didn't even see him at all but were both talking on a radio from cop to cop. I love that bond between those two lead heroes. I always love when McClane talks to himself whenever he was about to do something crazy. It is going to be 30 years anniversary this summer 20th July. I love this film to death I am hugh fan of Die Hard films I love this film so damn much. I would really love to see this movie in a widescreen in a movie theater. It was directed by brilliant John McTiernan it is is based on a novel Roderick Thorp Nothing Lasts Forever. This is a masterpiece action film that started all action genre one man army types battling terrorists while trapped in a confined space. It was arguably the first one in the action genre. This movie has everything . It has intense Action, Drama, Thriller, twists, great dialogue, explosions, fights. Exploding building, great helicopter explosion action scenes. John McClane is one man against a whole team of terrorists. A cracking Action Thriller from beginning to end, Die Hard explodes with heart-stopping suspense! It has great cast, great plot, great explosions, no shaky cam, doesn't deal with CGI, but real actions real practical effects. Great Direction from John McTiernan, great dialogues, great acting from everyone. Everyone does an excellent job. Bruce Willis is a bad ass action star as John McClane. It has a great bad-ass action hero who does impossible buy stopping the terrorists who were actually a real terrorists who try to steal the money in a vault 640.000.000$ in bearer bonds stored in the building's vault. My favorite action sequences and the best part of Die Hard: McClane grabs the fire hose, ties it around his body jumps with the helicopter about to kill him. Then Gruber blows it a second after McLane jumps off the roof! It was an incredible explosion that totally takes out the helicopter. But McLane is falling down the side of the building and needs to get inside quickly this is the best scene in the movie my favorite. McClane climbs in the elevator shaft escapes Karl and his men trying to kill him. McClane shoots on the table with his gun killing Marco. (According to the director, the proximity of the gun to Willis' ear during this scene caused permanent hearing loss for Willis.) 
McClane shot's Hans and Eddie ""Happy - Trails, Hans..."" Incredibly satisfying action in a brilliant action movie! McClane try to save Ellis when Ellis try to save him self. McClane was afraid of flying and he always carry gun because he was afraid someone would have hijack it. The fight between Karl and John was excellent and well choreographed. McClane drops C4 down the elevator shaft and destroys the entire floor where the terrorists are firing from, giving the cops a chance to retreat. I love The broken glass scene. He shoot's and kills two terrorists with his machine gun to escape Hans and Karl, John McClane is forced to sprint over broken glass while barefoot the best bad-ass scene in the movie my all time favorite. Three terrorists are shooting on McClane on the roof chasing him in which he escapes in the beginning of the movie awesome. Karl shoots in an elevator shaft in which McClane is hiding a real kick-ass scene I love this film to death! I love the characters in this movie: John McClane a real action hero to me that does something that no one can he stops a team of terrorists. Hans Grubar the German mastermind he was ruthless and brilliant and he would do anything to steal the money even killing people and get what he want's. Alan Rickman's performance was excellent I love him to death in this movie. I really miss the actor he was the best villain of the whole world. The LAPD Supervisor (Diana James) I like that girl she was so good when McClane call's her for help, I love it. I love Sgt. Al Powell how he stand's up and defends McClane against his supervisor. Reginald VelJohnson does a brilliant performance as a great supporting hero in this movie. I love Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson to death he is my favorite character in here. Paul Gleason was so good I love his performance - ""kick ass."" I love how he tried everything to safe the hostages including SWAT team who were badly hurt. I like Richard Thornburg in this movie who is annoying reporter but I still like it. Bonnie Bedelia as Holly McClane's wife was great.John McTiernan directed excellent this masterpiece Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza wrote a script that it delivers. The helicopters in here were models in this movie delivered, to me the action scenes felt realistic. This movie has ton's of action and you never get bored with it. Michael Kamen made a music score and you never get bored with it. You'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody rated R with real blood squibs. 10/10 it is my favorite action film in the action genre I love this film to death it is my personal action favorite film. I miss movies like this I miss action movies like this one today I want them back.

Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995) - IMDb,"Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995) is the third film in the popular Die Hard franchise, which re teamed Bruce Willis with John McTiernan, the director of the first film. It is my second favorite Die Hard film in the franchise. It feel's fast paced, more realistic and more action movie to me. It is not boring or slow, I love the characters: John McClane, Zeus Carver, Simon Gruber, Joe Lambert, Connie Kowalski, Charlie Weiss, Katya and Mathias Targo. No CGI real action sequences, real explosions, real stunt performances. McClane fires a power line, severing it in to the helicopter blowing up the chopper to pieces amazing my personal favorite scene. I love this movie to death, this is my movie and it is my personal favorite action film. Die Hard With A Vengeance (1995) is a near-perfect summer movie. It is one of my personal favorite action movies. It is so good as the first one, I couldn't decide which one I love to Death: Die Hard or Die Hard With a Vengeance. I love this movie to death it is my number 1 favorite action film in Die Hard series and action films. I love the original Die Hard to death but I love this sequel much more. That's my personal opinion. This franchise effort is a gleeful no-brainer with nonstop action. Die Hard With A Vengeance I really do believe is the greatest action sequel and a true masterpiece to the first movie. It gives some additional action pleasure, as we get to watch action heroes Bruce Willis get smacked around for 128 minutes. In this third outing with John McClane, we are faced with yet another mad bomber on the loose. Jeremy Irons plays Simon, an East German Special Forces Colonel-turned-terrorist mastermind and the older brother of Hans Gruber, who has a score to settle with Detective McClane. Simon's bombing game comes complete with crafty riddles, which must be solved in a specified time or everything goes boom. McClane has no choice but to play. Along the way, he picks up an unlikely accomplice named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson), a Harlem shopkeeper. Together they tear all over New York trying to head off disaster. Sure, it's all perfectly preposterous, but DIE HARD 3 has been directed with breathless intensity by John McTiernan, who certainly has a way with wrecking things. Was he very destructive as a child? Loved the spectacular subway crash, John. That hair-raising taxi ride through Central Park wasn't bad, either. I love the fact that they are saving kids from school. Charlie try's to disabled the bomb in school while Kowalski and Lambert are saving those kids stuck in the building I love that scene. McClane and Carver are desperately searching for the code for the bomb to disabled it, I love it to death. Don't forget to fasten your seat belts for this ride. It's often said that McTiernan and Hensleigh simply ignored Die Hard 2, and in terms of direct plot and dialogue references, this may be true, but they still give Die Hard 2 a nod by having an attendant humor--often almost ""goofy"" humor--in many action scenes. One of the most direct nods occurs with McClane ""riding"" something of an explosion (of water this time). This is one of the more hilarious scenes of the film.Die Hard with a Vengeance is a 1995 American action film and the third in the Die Hard film series. It was produced and directed by John McTiernan (who directed Die Hard), written by Jonathan Hensleigh, and stars Bruce Willis as New York City Police Department Lieutenant John McClane, Samuel L. Jackson as McClane's reluctant partner Zeus Carver, and Jeremy Irons as Simon Peter Gruber. Twenty years ago, after two blockbuster movies and a five-year wait, the ""Die Hard"" franchise roared back into theaters with the explosive ""Die Hard with a Vengeance."" The movie was released on May 19, 1995, and it was an instant classic, thanks to a smart script, exciting plot, and the absolutely stellar chemistry between Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. But not only was ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" a great movie, it was also arguably the best of its kind: unstoppable, and untoppable.Die Hard With A Vengeance was filmed before CGI made it possible to create scenes like this without breaking a single window, this moment is utter, terrifying perfection.How often do you get an action flick where the heroes spend the entire first half of the film solving puzzles to save lives? In a franchise that distinguishes itself with action that toes the line between ""creative"" and ""ridiculous,"" ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" stays on brand, in the best way.John McClane and a Harlem store owner are targeted by German terrorist Simon Gruber in New York City, where he plans to rob the Federal Reserve Building. 10/10 Score: bad Ass Seal Of Approval my personal second favorite Die

Dirty Harry (1971) - IMDb,"This film has it all, amazing soundtrack, amazing cinematography in the amazing San Francisco area, terrific cast of actors who played believable in their roles. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, story, cinematography. It is one of my personal favorite action movies of all time.Dirty Harry (1971) is Clint Eastwood's masterpiece and one of his best movies including the best memorable character! The movie that started it all! It is the best action thriller film from Clint Eastwood and director Don Siegel! Clint at his asskicking best! It is my favorite best film from Clint Eastwood and the first best one in the series. Even tough he did not directed this film he gave us one if his best performances ever! I love all Dirty Harry movies but this one is a classic and the best in the series. It has action suspense from end till beginning. A movie that will make anyone's day, if you feel lucky punk. I have seen the first one 20 times and will argue that it's the best with no question, but it is somewhat a matter of opinion :)""I know what your thinking. Did he fire six shots or just five? We'll Do I feel lucky? We'll do ya punk?"" Harry Callahan's best quotes. This is one classic Clint Eastwood film. He funnels traits of himself into ""Dirty"" Harry: no nonsense, dry humor, some charm and a good logical mind. Andrew Robinson had trouble getting work for a while after this movie because he did such a great job as Scorpio. Getting typecast as a psychopath kind of limits your casting options. Andrew Robinson also played in my favorite action Stallone flick Cobra (1986) and horror flick Hellraiser (1987). He did a great performance ever as a psychotic killer Scorpio. Reni Santoni was also cast in this movie as Harry's partner Homicide Inspector Chico Gonzalez. He also started 15 years later in my action flick Cobra (1986) alongside Andrew Robinson! I can say both of the actors did a fine job playing in bot cop flicks. First one is the best. But, a little bit of background is due. Academy Award-winner Clint Eastwood (""Unforgiven,"" ""Million Dollar Baby"") stars as ""Dirty Harry"" Callahan in this riveting action film that spawned several blockbuster sequels. In this original, Detective Harry Callahan is determined to bring in psychotic killer Robinson, even if he's determined to break some of the rules. Brilliantly filmed for maximum impact. Recently selected by the prestigious American Film Institute as one of the 400 greatest American films of all time and added ""Dirty Harry"" as part of the 50 Greatest Heroes of all time.Dirty Harry is a 1971 American action thriller film produced and directed by Don Siegel, the first in the Dirty Harry series. The basic plot is about catching a serial killer who was based on a Zodiac Killer. This is one of best movies ever. The story is good, acting is brilliant and effects and action scenes are epic. Watch this movie now!!!! Great films stick inside your head,and this one is a brain limpet! The cinematography and evocation of the San Francisco setting are hauntingly memorable,the dialogue taut and sparse and Schifrin's score is still super cool.Don Siegel and Clint must have studied the European stylists because I read Dirty Harry as the finest amalgam of US Noir and 60's new wave. I find echos of Antonioni and Melville in the tight,clean mis en scene and impeccable action sequences honed by Siegel's long Hollywood pedigree. superb.

Dirty Harry (1971) - IMDb,"The more I think about this film, the more the way this message movie was presented and the way it has been received by many really annoys me. I'm especially sensitized, given that Bush n' co. spent most of the last decade taking away our rights in the name of ""security"" & ""safety"". They must've loved this film!The message seems to be a very reactionary one. Rights/legal protections are bad. Rule of law is useless. Vigalante abuse of power is great.This movie is full of several logical fallacies, generalizations and other issues. It sets up a False Dilemma -either ignore the laws & get to kill the guy OR he goes free. It also sets up a Straw Man argument of picking a very rare/unlikely instance of a super psycho as an argument of why honoring the rights of criminals is bad.Sure, it's really easy to set up a grossly exaggerated portrait of an inhumanely disturbed racist monster who killed at random, raped & threatened children, threatens priests & had no redeeming values. Then show how all those pesky civil rights helped him go free and kill again. Blame the civil rights! Showing the rare instance when something that GENERALLY is a good thing failed (NOTE: it didn't work because HARRY did not follow the rules- not because the rules were there!) and then use that as an excuse to rant about the rules and make it seems as if there is no point to them.No grey areas. No thoughts as to what argument means if you carry it out the whole way through. No consideration on why those rights exist or the positives of protection, especially for someone who may be innocent.Think about it- how often does SF suffer at the hands of a madman serial killer? Not since the 70's. I just checked the crime stats for SF for the last 2 months. Not a single murder. Sure, SF isn't crime free there were probably a thousand or so burglaries, robberies, etc. But I'd much rather have strong rights and let a few people (mostly non-violent offenders) get to go free because their rights were protect then to not have Miranda rights or the 4th amendment. I'll take my chances that a psycho killer may come if it means I don't have to live in a fascist state with no expectation of privacy. I don't want some admittedly racist misanthropic cop who feels that he can doing anything he want & shoot anyone he wants if he even *thinks* they're being bad. What happens when Harry shoots an innocent person? What would have happened if that guy at Kezar stadium had been innocent and Harry had beat the crap out of him? Is that OK because Harry's *usually* killing bad guys?To be fair, I did check and it looks like ""exigent circumstances"" that allow for a LEGAL warrantless search if ""necessary to prevent physical harm"" doesn't appear to have become solidified until after the film (in '76)And what was the point of the lingering shot of the killer wearing a peace sign belt buckle? Was it merely supposed to be ironic because he was a killer? Or was it meant to equate a merciless killer with those stupid""peace-loving hippies"" who are causing murders to go free by advocating for rights and opposing oppressive police practices?In the end, I chose to read the final scene as Harry goading the killer into an action so that he had an excuse to shoot him. Then Harry realizing he had no right to uphold the law as an officer if he could not follow the laws. So he threw away the badge as an admission of his failure. However it seems to me as though many reviewers saw his action in an opposite light, of choosing to reject the rule of law and embrace his vigilante ways.",kyrat17,February/2010,5, Reactionary message movie with many logical fallacies,0,"[think, film, way, message, movie, present, way, receive, many, really, annoys, especially, sensitize, give, bush, n, spent, last, decade, take, away, right, name, security, safety, must, love, film, message, seems, reactionary, one, protection, bad, rule, law, useless, vigalante, abuse, power, movie, full, several, logical, fallacy, generalization, issue, set, false, dilemma, ignore, law, get, kill, guy, go, free, also, set, straw, man, argument, pick, instance, super, psycho, argument, honor, right, criminal, really, easy, set, grossly, exaggerate, portrait, inhumanely, disturbed, racist, monster, kill, random, rap, threaten, child, threatens, priest, redeem, value, show, pesky, civil, right, help, go, free, kill, blame, civil, right, ...]","[the more i, think, about, this film, more, way, this message movie, was presented, the way it, has been received, by, many, really annoys, me, i, am especially sensitized, given, that, bush n, co, spent, most, of, the last decade, taking, away, our rights, in, the name, of, security, safety, they, must have loved, this film!the message, seems, to, be, very reactionary, rights/legal protections, are, bad, rule, of, law, is, useless, vigalante abuse, of, power, is great.this, movie, is, full, of, several logical fallacies, generalizations and other issues, it, sets, up, a false dilemma, ignore, the laws, get, to, kill, the guy, he, goes, free, it also sets, up, a straw man argument, of, picking, a very rare/unlikely instance, of, a super psycho, as, an argument, of, why, honoring, the rights, of, criminals, is, bad.sure, it, is, really easy, to, set, up, grossly exaggerated, portrait, of, inhumanely disturbed, racist monster, killed, ...]",175.16428795092358,-7.482880949572625,0,1,1,1,0,2,1,0,3,3,1,1,4,1,3,1,0,1,2,0,5.771186440677966,236,323,think film way message movie presented way received many really annoys especially sensitized given bush n co spent last decade taking away rights name security safety must loved film message seems reactionary rights legal protections bad rule law useless vigalante abuse power great movie full several logical fallacies generalizations issues sets false dilemma either ignore laws kill guy goes free sets straw man argument picking rare unlikely instance super psycho argument honoring rights criminals bad sure really easy set grossly exaggerated portrait inhumanely disturbed racist monster killed random raped threatened children threatens priests redeeming values show pesky civil rights helped free kill blame civil rights showing rare instance something generally good thing failed note work harry follow rules rules use excuse rant rules seems point grey areas thoughts argument means carry whole way consideration rights exist positives protection especially someone may innocent think often sf suffer hands madman serial killer since 70s checked crime stats sf last 2 months single murder sure sf crime free probably thousand burglaries robberies etc would much rather strong rights let people mostly non violent offenders free rights protect miranda rights 4th amendment take chances psycho killer may means live fascist state expectation privacy want admittedly racist misanthropic cop feels anything want shoot anyone wants even thinks bad happens harry shoots innocent person would happened guy kezar stadium innocent harry beat crap ok harrys usually killing bad guys fair check looks like exigent circumstances allow legal warrantless search necessary prevent physical harm appear become solidified film 76 point lingering shot killer wearing peace sign belt buckle merely supposed ironic killer meant equate merciless killer stupid peace loving hippies causing murders free advocating rights opposing oppressive police practices end chose read final scene harry goading killer action excuse shoot harry realizing right uphold law officer could follow laws threw away badge admission failure however seems though many reviewers saw action opposite light choosing reject rule law embrace vigilante ways,0.05602753727753729,0.5507495590828925,1
District 9 (2009) - IMDb,"I do not give out ratings of 10 lightly, but here it is - the first film in years that has been deserving of the rating.Neill Blomkamp brings to screens a fantastic, gritty, realistic piece of science fiction with District 9. Not since Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"", John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", or James Cameron's ""Aliens"" have we seen a science fiction film with a vision of this caliber. After viewing District 9, it will be clear to one and all why Peter Jackson put so much faith in Blomkamp and took him under his wing as protégé.Abandoning the usual settings of Hollywood sci-fi and placing us in the harsh slums of South Africa, we are given an original piece of work which takes risks in the way it tells its story. Not only does it go against the expectations of audiences who have been trained to expect mediocrity from their sci-fi, it goes above and beyond the call of duty to provide us with spectacle as well as something to ponder after we've downed our popcorn.There is, thankfully, not an overused, overexposed celebrity in sight, and every unknown face in the film gives a solid performance.

District 9 (2009) - IMDb,"I am appalled that so many people love this film, with many claiming it to be a masterpiece. It was the rave reviews and the high ratings that influenced my decision to watch this film, but now that I have seen it, I honestly do not see what all the buzz is about. This movie failed to deliver on almost every end. The characters were flat, the filming style was annoying, and the plot was unbelievable with too many holes. SpoilersWhile the action isn't great either, the main problem with the film is that it makes an obvious attempt to appeal to the empathy of the audience and horrible fails at it because of absurdity. The success of this movie relies on whether or not the audience actually cares about the main character, Wikus, but there is no character development. The so called bond between the alien wearing the red clothes and Wikus, is laughable. The movie barely shows them together throughout the film, but for some unapparent reason, we're expected to accept that by the end of the movie they've developed a close bond out of thin air. A bond that they are willing to risk their lives for. ""I won't leave you"", says the aliens, ""I'll come back...I promise"". Huh?... What a load of ridiculous crap. Was I supposed to shed a tear at that moment. For those of you who actually felt emotional at that moment, I worry for you. I mean, Wikus was not even a likable guy. The whole time he acted like an asshole and he had an utterly annoying accent. Did the director of this movie expect us to actually care about the guy. I sure as hell didn't. He was a selfish bastard throughout the whole movie, who only cared about himself. The only reason I could come up with for why he protected the alien at the end was that it was his only chance of becoming human again. I can honestly say that I think that he got what he deserved. The story also contains too many flaws. Gaping flaws that make this movie nearly unwatchable. For this part I'll just ask all the questions that I have. I mean, how is it possible that the aliens got stranded on Earth in the first place and then after 20 some years, the mothership seems to magically work again? Why does alien fuel turn a guy into an alien? Why would the aliens have an antidote for a guy turning into an alien? Why would Wikus only cut off a finger? Why didn't the aliens retaliate with their superior technology? Why would the government allow the aliens to be so loosely controlled? Why do the aliens act like savages even though they are supposed to be an advanced race? Why can't the aliens contact their planet, wouldn't they have the technology? Why are humans allowed to stay in District 9? Why would Wikus's wife actual believe that he performed some sort of sexual activity with an alien? Why is a spaceship buried under ground? Am I missing something? Yes, I am being a bit too critical, but it's just because people keep saying that this movie is so so great and it bothers me. I have much more to say, but I'll just leave it at this. I give this movie a 4 out of 10.",batatas3118,August/2009,1, Very disappointed by both the movie and the other reviewers.,0,"[appalled, many, people, love, film, many, claim, masterpiece, rave, review, high, rating, influence, decision, watch, film, see, honestly, see, buzz, movie, fail, deliver, almost, every, end, character, flat, film, style, annoy, plot, unbelievable, many, hole, spoilerswhile, action, great, either, main, problem, film, make, obvious, attempt, appeal, empathy, audience, horrible, fails, absurdity, success, movie, relies, whether, audience, actually, care, main, character, wikus, character, development, call, bond, alien, wear, red, clothes, wikus, laughable, movie, barely, show, together, throughout, film, unapparent, reason, expect, accept, end, movie, developed, close, bond, thin, air, bond, willing, risk, life, leave, say, alien, come, back, promise, huh, load, ...]","[i, am appalled, that, so many people, love, this film, with, many claiming it, to, be, a masterpiece, it, was, the rave reviews, the high ratings, that, influenced, my decision, to, watch, this film, now, that, i, have seen, it, i, honestly do not see, all the buzz, is, about, this movie, failed, to, deliver, on, almost, every end, the characters, were, flat, the filming style, was, annoying, the plot, was, unbelievable, with, too many holes, spoilerswhile, the action, is not great, the main problem, with, the film, is, that, it, makes, an obvious attempt, to, appeal, to, the empathy, of, the audience, horrible, fails, at, it, because, of, absurdity, the success, of, this movie, relies, on whether, not, the audience, actually cares, about, the main character, wikus, is, no character development, so called, bond, between, the alien wearing, the red clothes, wikus, is, laughable, the movie, barely shows, them, together, throughout, the film, ...]",78.74883731212724,1.4639123072000155,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,3,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.7727272727272725,176,247,appalled many people love film many claiming masterpiece rave reviews high ratings influenced decision watch film seen honestly buzz movie failed deliver almost every end characters flat filming style annoying plot unbelievable many holes spoilerswhile action great either main problem film makes obvious attempt appeal empathy audience horrible fails absurdity success movie relies whether audience actually cares main character wikus character development called bond alien wearing red clothes wikus laughable movie barely shows together throughout film unapparent reason expected accept end movie developed close bond thin air bond willing risk lives leave says aliens promise huh load ridiculous crap supposed shed tear moment actually felt emotional moment worry mean wikus even likable guy whole time acted like asshole utterly annoying accent director movie expect us actually care guy sure hell selfish bastard throughout whole movie cared reason could protected alien end chance becoming human honestly think got deserved story contains many flaws gaping flaws movie nearly unwatchable part questions mean possible aliens got stranded earth first place 20 years mothership seems magically work alien fuel turn guy alien would aliens antidote guy turning alien would wikus cut finger aliens retaliate superior technology would government allow aliens loosely controlled aliens act like savages even though supposed advanced race aliens contact planet would technology humans allowed stay district 9 would wikuss wife actual believe performed sort sexual activity alien spaceship buried ground missing something yes bit critical people keep saying movie great bothers much leave give movie 4 10,0.021953601953601947,0.5695468728802061,1
Double Team (1997) - IMDb,"Double Team is the third movie that Van Damme has done for a former HONG-KONG action-movie director. He has done ""Hard Target"" for John Woo and ""Maximum Risk"" for Ringo Lam.  Double Team is directed by rather splendid Tsui Hark.  Hark is excellent at directing action-scenes and Double Team is a good way for him to start in Hollywood. Van Damme plays agent Jack Quinn, and is sent out to kill super-terrorist Stavros, who is played by Mickey Rourke.  Quinn fails and is therefore sent sent to a place called ""The Colony"".  ""The Colony"" is a place where the world's most dangerous terrorists/agents are sent. These agents/terrorists are too dangerous to go free on the street and too valuable to kill.  Quinn escapes from the colony and goes after Stavroes for revenge.  Quinn is helped by Yaz, who is played by the basket-star Dennis Rodmann.  Double Team is full of well made action and martial-art scenes. However, it`s far from perfect.  The whole plot is very silly, there are huge logical gaps and holes in the story and Mickey Rourke is far from convincing as a villain. Double Team isn`t a film for everybody.

Double Team (1997) - IMDb,"Continuing the tradition of successful Hong Kong directors going to Hollywood only to end up directing Jean-Claude Van Damme movies comes Tsui Hark with 'Double Team'. John Woo must have gotten lucky when he went to Hollywood: Ringo Lam is still making Van Damme movies, and Tsui Hark went back to Hong Kong after this and 'Knock Off'. I have nothing against Van Damme, but he seems to be some sort of trial-by-fire for any Hong Kong director with ambitions of making action films in Hollywood: If a director succeeds, he go on to Dolph Lundgren and then mainstream Hollywood action (John Woo), otherwise the director is faced with sticking with Van Damme movies or going back to Hong Kong.Counter-terrorist Jack Quinn (Van Damme) is planning to retire after one final mission to nail the villainous Stavros (Mickey Rourke). The mission goes incredibly wrong: Stravos gets away, but somehow his son is killed in the cross-fire. Out for revenge, Stavros kidnaps the pregnant Kathryn Quinn (Natacha Lindinger), and the only way Jack can save is wife is team up with Yaz (Dennis Rodman) and kick-box his way to a happy ending.Watching 'Double Team', I thought it was pretty clear than even Van Damme realizes that his movies are a joke to all but the most hardcore of action fans. Australian sketch comedy show 'Full Frontal' (featuring a not-so-famous Eric Bana) regularly took stabs at Van Damme for a good year or so (""YOU LAUGHTER CRACKIN' AT ME? ARRRGGGHHHHH!""), coincidentally around when 'Double Team' would have been released. At no point does 'Double Team' make any attempt to be taken as a serious action movie. All the fight scenes are played for laughs, if only slight chuckles. Van Damme gets to fight a tiger and use a coke-machine to shield himself from an explosion. All it really amounts to be is 90 minutes of action fun.While fans of director Tsui Hark would be disappointed with this effort, something good came of Hark's short-lived collaborations with Van Damme: He went back to Hong Kong and directed the incredibly awesome 'Time and Tide' (which did not feature Jean-Claude Van Damme at all).'Double Team' doesn't come to close to being one of Van Damme's best, and it might not even please hard-core Van Damme fans, but its all in good fun - 5/10",AwesomeWolf1,June/2005,5, Van Damme v. a Tiger!,0,"[continue, tradition, successful, hong, kong, director, go, hollywood, end, direct, van, damme, movie, come, tsui, hark, wouldouble, team, john, woo, must, gotten, lucky, go, hollywood, ringo, lam, still, make, van, damme, movie, tsui, hark, go, back, hong, kong, nothing, van, damme, seems, sort, hong, kong, director, ambition, make, action, film, hollywood, director, succeeds, go, dolph, lundgren, mainstream, hollywood, action, john, woo, otherwise, director, face, stick, van, damme, movie, go, back, hong, jack, quinn, van, damme, planning, retire, one, final, mission, nail, villainous, stavros, mickey, rourke, mission, go, incredibly, wrong, stravos, get, away, somehow, son, kill, revenge, stavros, kidnaps, pregnant, kathryn, ...]","[continuing, the tradition, of, successful hong kong directors, going, to, hollywood, only, to, end, up, directing, jean-claude van, damme, movies, comes, tsui, hark, with, wouldouble team, john woo, must have gotten, lucky, when, he, went, to, hollywood, ringo lam, is still making, van, damme, movies, tsui, hark went, back, to, hong kong, after, knock, off, i, have nothing against, van, damme, he, seems, to, be, some sort, of, trial-by-fire, for, any hong kong director, with, ambitions, of, making, action films, in, hollywood, if, a director, succeeds, he, go, on to, dolph lundgren, then mainstream hollywood action, john woo, otherwise, the director, is faced, with, sticking, with, van damme movies, going, back, to, hong, kong.counter-terrorist jack quinn, van, damme, is planning, to, retire, after, one final mission, to, nail, the villainous stavros, mickey rourke, the mission, goes, incredibly wrong, stravos, gets, away, somehow, ...]",59.810104537982205,17.78374969114768,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.703947368421053,152,240,continuing tradition successful hong kong directors going hollywood end directing jean claude van damme movies comes tsui hark double team john woo must gotten lucky went hollywood ringo lam still making van damme movies tsui hark went hong kong knock nothing van damme seems sort trial fire hong kong director ambitions making action films hollywood director succeeds dolph lundgren mainstream hollywood action john woo otherwise director faced sticking van damme movies going hong kong counter terrorist jack quinn van damme planning retire final mission nail villainous stavros mickey rourke mission goes incredibly wrong stravos gets away somehow son killed cross fire revenge stavros kidnaps pregnant kathryn quinn natacha lindinger way jack save wife team yaz dennis rodman kick box way happy ending watching double team thought pretty clear even van damme realizes movies joke hardcore action fans australian sketch comedy show full frontal featuring famous eric bana regularly took stabs van damme good year laughter crackin arrrggghhhhh coincidentally around double team would released point double team attempt taken serious action movie fight scenes played laughs slight chuckles van damme gets fight tiger use coke machine shield explosion really amounts 90 minutes action fun fans director tsui hark would disappointed effort something good came harks short lived collaborations van damme went hong kong directed incredibly awesome time tide feature jean claude van damme double team close van dammes best might even please hard core van damme fans good fun 5 10,0.19144736842105262,0.3925944669365721,1

Driven (2001) - IMDb,"It's been often mentioned by other reviewers that the art of the cornball must have been engineered by Sylvester Stallone;  it's just as often forgotten that true tripe goes unwatched merely because it does not go into wide, national release.  So guess which movies always receive the worse rep?Having watched the trailer and anticipated this movie for a while, I knew exactly what to expect beforehand: your typical good guy vs. bad guy, fight for glory, 'win-all-lose-all final confrontation' fare.  Surprisingly, I encountered something that attempted to be a little more profound, and while it doesn't exactly hint at the meaning of existence, it explores a facet of human relationships which not many other movies in this genre have touched. The movie's tagline, ""Welcome to the human race,"" does a nice job of encompassing all that this film discusses.The peculiar thing about the entire setup is that, unlike all other movies in this genre, there are no defined lines.  There is no good guy, no bad guy;  simply a race for perfection that alludes to the way that most of us wish to live, though the path that we take is an altogether different matter.  It's difficult to pick up on, but if enough attention is paid, the idiosyncrasies of each of the characters in this movie speak far more than what their dialogue brings to the table.Where the film falters, and causes most of the audience to misperceive its message, is in its presentation.  It's frenetic, loud, and highly distracting;  and yet, tremendously appealing to this particular viewer. The speed with which the director cuts between shots, pans, zooms, spins, spirals, etc., go hand in hand with the feel of the sport in general, and is indeed very creative -- but it is hard to keep up with what's going on.  How are we supposed to know what each character is feeling when the scene cuts away before the dialogue is even finished?  How are we supposed to be even able to recognize what's happening on the screen when we're not given more than a two-second break between blaringly obtrusive rock songs?  Once again, the movie alludes to the sport itself with the commercialization of its soundtrack.  And while highly kinetic, and emotionally involving at times (the opening scene with the media was brilliantly executed for a Jimmy Bly point of view), it's just hard to...keep track of everything.But in the end, the main reason anybody is going to watch this movie for is the racing, particularly the accidents that take place at excesses of 200 miles per hour.  And it delivers pretty admirably, truth be told.  There are a lot of interesting camera positions and perspectives to make you feel a part of the race, and the special effects could be considered top-notch. Kudos to whoever decided to not give the CG cars and items the cheap, laughter-inducing fluidity of movement that's to be found in just about any other movie with computer graphics (though there were a few scenes with this effect).  It's not necessarily realistic, and a little simplistic on the artistic scale, but it reaches a satisfying level of subtlety--and at times, it's fascinating to see some of the things that can be done.The film is not without its clichés, it sometimes forgets about or fails to discuss a few of its plot points, and the women appear to be portrayed a little 2-dimensionally.  But when the crew is watching the race or practice runs from the movie's dramatic camera angles on their small overhead monitor, you simply don't care.

Driven (2001) - IMDb,"As a big auto racing fan, CART in particular, I awaited this movie since the mid-90's when it was discussed as a Formula One movie.  However, Formula One wouldn't allow the access that it did for Grand Prix in 1966, so the director defaulted to the North American CART series.  CART allowed unprecedented access to its venues, races, paddock, announcers, drivers, sponsors, etc.  But this movie fails in that it is nothing more than an auto racing cliché.  As a fan, it's hard to rebuff the blood sport aspect of the sport to those who are not fans.  The crashes are incredibly unrealistic, some of the tracks are non-existent and the drivers are paper thin.  The scene near the swimming pool with the blonde vixen doing some sort of goofy water aerobics is pathetic.  The part where Jimmy Bly steals a car (that happens to be filled with fuel indoors and doesn't need an external starter to run) and drives it through the Chicago streets with Stalone in tow is just ridiculous.  And to they get arrested or even prosecuted for this action?  No, they just are forced to convey one of the stupidest dialogues in the history of racing movies.The CART series is in serious trouble in real life.  A movie about the excitement of the series, the strategy, the action and the pageantry of racing could have boosted the series back to national respectability. However, this movie just hinders its descent into oblivion with the Can-Am series.

Drunken Master (1978) - IMDb,"The film that made Jackie Chan a star, Yuen Wo-Ping's ""Drunken Master"" constitutes a departure from previous Hong Kong cinema with its intensely comedic elements, while paying tribute to more ancient Chinese cultural traditions. The movie has very little plot relying instead on Jackie Chan's low-brow, Three Stooges-esquire comedic timing, and his acrobatic ability.It begins with an action scene and really doesn't let up until the very end of the film. The plot concerns a feckless kung fu student (Chan) whose father forces him to study the fighting style of the Eight Drunken Gods. Of course, this means that Jackie fights his many opponents acting as if he is drunk. His physical comedy is impressive, such as his drunken stagger, his slapstick demeanor, and his acrobatic artistry is breathtaking. Chan was raised in the Peking opera, where he learned acrobatics and dancing in addition to the martial arts. This gives his fighting style a unique fluidity, as he tumbles, falls, and leaps out of the way of opponent's blows rather than confronting them head on, fist-to-fist. Most of the movie is really just him using his acrobatics to escape from superior enemies rather than actually fighting them. As impressive physically as this is, few fights actually seem to have any resolution, meaning that the fights do little to advance the narrative, functioning similarly to Busby Berkeley show-stoppers in his 1930 musicals. Most of Chan's comedy is low humor, involving bodily functions, vomiting, hitting other people a la the Three Stooges, drunkenness, and harassing the opposite sex. The action scenes become monumentally repetitive, having a mind-numbing effect on the viewer by the time you reach the end of the movie. The acting is distorted and exaggerated for comedic effect, but becomes shamelessly boring when combined with the redundant action scenes. The only reason why I give this movie a 5 is for Chan's acrobatic ability. Really, that is the only thing going for this movie, since Yuen Wo-Ping doesn't concentrate at all on mastering the film's formal qualities. The editing is choppy with poor coverage of the individual scenes. Clearly all the fight scenes were edited in camera, so the emphasis is more on the choreography of the fights rather than the filming of them, making them seem rather static and lifeless actually. The movie fails in its formal, textual qualities, so its only draw is Jackie Chan's childish humor and acrobatics.",c-blauvelt13,April/2006,5," 110 minutes of acrobatic physicality that is mindless, heartless, and without a story",0,"[film, make, jackie, chan, star, yuen, drunken, master, constitutes, departure, previous, hong, kong, cinema, intensely, comedic, element, pay, tribute, ancient, chinese, cultural, tradition, movie, little, plot, rely, instead, jackie, chan, three, comedic, timing, acrobatic, begin, action, scene, really, let, end, film, plot, concern, feckless, kung, fu, student, chan, whose, father, force, study, fight, style, eight, drunken, god, course, mean, jackie, fight, many, opponent, act, drunk, physical, comedy, impressive, drunken, stagger, slapstick, demeanor, acrobatic, artistry, breathtaking, chan, raise, peking, opera, learn, acrobatics, dance, addition, martial, art, give, fight, style, unique, fluidity, tumble, fall, leap, way, opponent, blow, rather, confront, head, movie, ...]","[the film, that, made, jackie chan a star, yuen, wo-ping, drunken master, constitutes, a departure, from, previous hong kong cinema, with, its intensely comedic elements, while, paying, tribute, to, more ancient, chinese, cultural traditions, the movie, has, very little plot, relying, instead, on, jackie chan, low-brow, three stooges-esquire comedic timing, his, acrobatic ability.it, begins, with, an action scene, really does not let, up until, the very end, of, the film, the plot, concerns, a feckless kung fu student, chan, father forces him, to, study, the fighting style, of, the eight drunken gods, of, course, means, that, jackie fights his many opponents, acting, as if, he, is, drunk, his physical comedy, is, impressive, such, as, his drunken stagger, his slapstick demeanor, his, acrobatic artistry, is, breathtaking, chan, was raised, in, the peking opera, where, he, learned, acrobatics and dancing, in, addition, to, the martial arts, gives, his fighting, style, a unique fluidity, as, he, tumbles, falls, leaps, out of, the way, of, opponent, blows, rather, than, confronting, them, ...]",54.93947524426297,5.081049303605948,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,1,4,0,5,0,4,6.1125,160,229,film made jackie chan star yuen wo pings drunken master constitutes departure previous hong kong cinema intensely comedic elements paying tribute ancient chinese cultural traditions movie little plot relying instead jackie chans low brow stooges esquire comedic timing acrobatic ability begins action scene really let end film plot concerns feckless kung fu student chan whose father forces study fighting style drunken gods course means jackie fights many opponents acting drunk physical comedy impressive drunken stagger slapstick demeanor acrobatic artistry breathtaking chan raised peking opera learned acrobatics dancing addition martial arts gives fighting style unique fluidity tumbles falls leaps way opponents blows rather confronting head fist fist movie really using acrobatics escape superior enemies rather actually fighting impressive physically fights actually seem resolution meaning fights little advance narrative functioning similarly busby berkeley show stoppers 1930 musicals chans comedy low humor involving bodily functions vomiting hitting people la stooges drunkenness harassing opposite sex action scenes become monumentally repetitive mind numbing effect viewer time reach end movie acting distorted exaggerated comedic effect becomes shamelessly boring combined redundant action scenes reason give movie 5 chans acrobatic ability really thing going movie since yuen wo ping concentrate mastering films formal qualities editing choppy poor coverage individual scenes clearly fight scenes edited camera emphasis choreography fights rather filming making seem rather static lifeless actually movie fails formal textual qualities draw jackie chans childish humor acrobatics,0.04844961240310078,0.40199335548172754,1
Drunken Master II (1994) - IMDb,"Well, Jackie Chan has had an interesting career. On one hand, he's made some classics like Project A and Dragons Forever. On the other hand, he's made some less-than-spectacular movies like Crime Story and First Strike. This movie is easily his best film ever...and also one the best martial arts movies ever made. He revisits the role that made him famous: Wong Fei Hung, the drunken master. The plot deals with smugglers trying to steal China's treasures, but in the end it isn't important. The fights are what matters, and Chan fights like a son of a gun. There are some excellent traditional fight scenes like him fighting Lau Kar Leung and one w/ a Choy li fut stylist. There's a memorable fight against an Ax Gang (Ax army is more like it). The finale, where he takes on the smugglers led by a super kicking Thai boxer, is probably the greatest fight scene choreographed. This movie doesn't cease to entertain.

Dunkirk (2017) - IMDb,"Dunkirk is, in my opinion, yet another masterpiece from mastermind Christopher Nolan. Since everything that is brilliant about the film has already been said I will briefly write what I think of the film and also touch on a topic that some people are criticizing the movie for.The fantastically directed film is told from 3 perspectives non chronologically. It superbly tackles the narrative and the non linear story doesn't at all pull you away from the intensity of the events happening on screen that don't stop from 00:00 to the last scene. Hans Zimmer most likely gives one of the most fitting scores for a war film ever. Sometimes there is only one note playing followed by heartbeat sounds and a ticking clock while other times a massive orchestra is interpreting what is going on on screen. The movie brilliantly projects the feeling of each and every soldier on the beach to the audience. Confusion, turmoil and fear. The cinematography was breathtaking and I felt anxious throughout most of the run time. There is no lead in this film and I can't really say anyone stuck out as giving a brilliant performance because it wasn't needed and I'll explain why.The biggest criticisms of Dunkirk that I've heard of so far are that the characters are lacking in depth and that we aren't given anything to be invested in them. I feel like Nolan was trying (successfully) to make the audience care for each and every one of the men on the beach. He needed to have some form of ""main characters"" to be in the story so that we can see the events unfold from the direct perspective of all of the soldiers. Usually in war films (I'll use saving private Ryan as an example) the plot revolves around certain soldiers (like Cpt. Miller and Ryan) being in a war and doing things in the war but its still about THEM not THE WAR as much. In my opinion Dunkirk is a telling the STORY OF DUNKIRK. Not of Harry Style's character or Tom Hardy's character but of Dunkirk. What any of the ""main characters"" felt, every other soldier felt. Nolan resorted more to film-making techniques to tell the story rather than dialogue and that is why some people might have had a problem with the lack of character depth but realistically this type of terrible event wouldn't be a place for someone to ""develop"" as a character but rather a event where MEN WANTED ONLY SURVIVAL, and Nolan showed that perfectly. As for what the top review of Dunkirk on IMDb says about 'lack of emotion' in the film, I believe this to be a completely incorrect statement. Maybe he was referring to the lack of 'brotherhood amongst men' or the feeling of moral or something epic like that. Again the longing for the 'Saving Private Ryan' format of war films. What the reviewer fails to see is that realistically there was NO emotion on that beach besides fear and confusion. And I can safely say that Nolan and Zimmer and the DP all successfully gave us those feelings.9.5/10",nimdude22,July/2017,10," A short review with a longer explanation of why its OK that this movie didn't have any ""characters""",1,"[dunkirk, opinion, yet, another, masterpiece, mastermind, christopher, nolan, since, everything, brilliant, film, already, say, briefly, write, think, film, also, touch, topic, people, criticize, movie, fantastically, direct, film, told, perspective, non, chronologically, superbly, tackle, narrative, non, linear, story, pull, away, intensity, event, happen, screen, stop, last, scene, han, zimmer, likely, give, one, fitting, score, war, film, ever, sometimes, one, note, play, follow, heartbeat, sound, tick, clock, time, massive, orchestra, interpret, go, screen, movie, brilliantly, project, feel, every, soldier, beach, audience, confusion, turmoil, fear, cinematography, breathtaking, felt, anxious, throughout, run, time, lead, film, really, say, anyone, stuck, give, brilliant, performance, need, explain, ...]","[dunkirk, is, in, my opinion, yet, another masterpiece, from, mastermind christopher nolan, since, everything, is, brilliant, about, the film, has already been said, i, will briefly, write, i, think, of, the film, also touch, on, a topic, that, some people, are criticizing, the movie, for.the, fantastically directed, film, is told, from, 3 perspectives, chronologically, it, superbly tackles, the narrative, linear story, does not at, all pull you, away, from, the intensity, of, the events, happening, on, screen, do not stop, from, to, the last scene, hans, zimmer, most, likely, gives, of, the most fitting scores, for, a war film, ever, sometimes, is, only, one note, playing followed, by, heartbeat, sounds, a ticking clock, while, other, times, a massive orchestra, is interpreting, is going, on on, screen, the movie, brilliantly, projects, the feeling, of, each and every soldier, on, the beach, to, the audience, confusion, turmoil and fear, the cinematography, was, breathtaking and i, felt, anxious, throughout, most of, ...]",78.83732063106605,8.672051542960531,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,3,1,4,0,5,5,4,6.029411764705883,170,251,dunkirk opinion yet another masterpiece mastermind christopher nolan since everything brilliant film already said briefly write think film touch topic people criticizing movie fantastically directed film told 3 perspectives non chronologically superbly tackles narrative non linear story pull away intensity events happening screen stop 00 00 last scene hans zimmer likely gives fitting scores war film ever sometimes note playing followed heartbeat sounds ticking clock times massive orchestra interpreting going screen movie brilliantly projects feeling every soldier beach audience confusion turmoil fear cinematography breathtaking felt anxious throughout run time lead film really anyone stuck giving brilliant performance needed explain biggest criticisms dunkirk heard far characters lacking depth given anything invested feel like nolan trying successfully audience care every men beach needed form main characters story events unfold direct perspective soldiers usually war films use saving private ryan example plot revolves around certain soldiers like cpt miller ryan war things war still war much opinion dunkirk telling story dunkirk harry styles character tom hardys character dunkirk main characters felt every soldier felt nolan resorted film making techniques story rather dialogue people might problem lack character depth realistically type terrible event would place someone develop character rather event men wanted survival nolan showed perfectly top review dunkirk imdb says lack emotion film believe completely incorrect statement maybe referring lack brotherhood amongst men feeling moral something epic like longing saving private ryan format war films reviewer fails realistically emotion beach besides fear confusion safely nolan zimmer dp successfully gave us feelings 9 5 10,0.23492063492063492,0.6062698412698412,1
Dunkirk (2017) - IMDb,"I was very disappointed with this movie. I have liked previous Nolan movies but this one left me feeling cheated that I had spent that much money to see it. It was boring and unrealistic.One scene had a ship getting hit with a bomb and immediately rolling on it's side then remaining afloat.At the end a plane runs out of fuel and seemingly defies the laws of physics by gliding forever and ever shooting down a plane before landing on the beach. They kept showing shots of the beach with lines of soldiers that nowhere approximated over 400,000 soldiers. Same with the amount of ships and boats and planes.

Eega (2012) - IMDb,"Before I begin this review, I would like to take a moment to salute Mr. S.S.Rajamouli for coming up with an entertainer that has pushed the boundaries of our filmmaking. Eega makes us all proud to be a part of the Telugu Film Industry.'Eega' has released across the world today in a big way and the movie has been directed by S.S.Rajamouli. Music has been scored by Keeravani and the film has Samantha,Nani and Sudeep in lead roles. The movie has some outstanding performances but Sudeep takes the cake. He is terrific as the villainous guy and his screen presence is riveting. Sudeep is a major asset for the movie.Samantha comes up with a good performance and she looks very cute in the movie. Her interaction sequences with the Eega are heartwarming.Nani delivers a humorous and spirited performance in the brief role that he has. He has good comedy timing. Srinivasa Reddy and Thagubothu Ramesh bring a few laughs.S.S. Rajamouli's direction and screenplay deserve special mention. The story moves along at a terrific pace and the buildup to the interval is amazing. Good humor and solid drama keep viewers deeply involved in the film. The special effects are of very high quality and they have never been seen in Telugu Cinema before.The emotional struggle of the Eega and its cute mannerisms will endear it to kids. Don't be surprised if your kids bug you for an Eega toy after this movie.The climax block and the way the Eega extracts its revenge on the villain is shown brilliantly. Eega also performs Chiranjeevi's Indra step and Jr NTR's Yamadonga step during the climax title cards. Visual effects and CGI images are of a very high quality and they are worth applauding. Eega's revenge sequences have been well conceived by Rajamouli and the SFX team. As I said before, Eega makes us all proud to be a part of the Telugu Film Industry. It is wildly entertaining, hilarious at times and the Eega really endears itself to viewers. Don't miss out on 'Eega'. These kind of films don't come very often.

Eega (2012) - IMDb,"Eega is tagged as ultimate revenge story and you should watch the film to know why it is! This is really an ultimate entertainer where there is no big commercial hero to shoulder it. However, audience would connect with the Eega and its revenge right away. How many times have you seen crowds cheering a housefly's entry? Eega is not less than any commercial hero, at least in this film.Rajamouli's has done very good research on the houseflies. He captured every tiny movements and incorporated in the film. He used the tininess of the protagonist to good effect and there are tons of scenes that would leave you awestruck. Watch out for the scene where Eega causes a traffic jam and the scene where it gets back into the running car through ac window.Only a great director could imagine such scenes and bring them on to the screen with such finesse. Rajamouli ranks among the best directors that India has ever produced. Eega proves that he is the commercial guru of cinema. He made a film which is totally different and yet commercially viable.All the sections of audience could enjoy this film as Rajamouli dealt it in typical Telugu commercial filmy style. There are elements that caters to every section. Except for the fact that the logic has gone for a toss, Eega is pretty good on every level. May be the screenplay could have been fine tuned as there are some hiccups in between.Nevertheless, Eega entertains and engages throughout. There are scenes where you would watch the action with closed fists. Should we give better example to say that this film succeeds? Eega is an experience that should never be missed.

Elephant White (2011) - IMDb,"Was this the best movie I have ever seen? Absolutely not. Was it the worst movie I have ever seen? No again.

Elite Squad (2007) - IMDb,"Tropa de Elite is an amazingly good film; by turns brutally real and horrifyingly hilarious.It claims to be based on a true story and I find that sadly believable. The main plot revolves around the captain of an elite police unit trying to find a replacement for himself, while dealing with the birth of his child and the horrendous stress of his job, and a mission to clear out a dangerously violent slum.There are no wholly good people in the movie, and it's frighteningly easy to compare some of what goes on to things happening in the USA (and other places) today. That said, the system of government and policing portrayed comes across as so amazingly inept and awful that it's almost like something straight out of a nightmarish sci-fi dystopia.If I had to compare it to other movies, it comes off as a cross between Brazil, Office Space, and Full Metal Jacket.

End of Watch (2012) - IMDb,"It's not hard to tell that David Ayer grew up on the mean streets of South Central, Los Angeles. Training Day, The Fast and the Furious, Dark Blue and S.W.A.T. all showcase his passion for writing screenplays about these streets and the role that police officers play in them. His two films as director (Harsh Times and Street Kings) showed that he could also direct hard hitting dramas depicting the underbelly of the L.A. and the police force. End Of Watch marks Ayer's second film as both writer and director.Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña star as a two young officers in the Los Angeles Police Department. Using the ""home footage"" format of filmmaking, End Of Watch shows us the ups and downs of these two young officers as they work, love and fight in the streets of Los Angeles.In terms of subject matter this film doesn't cover anything really different. Its about cops dealing with their issues at home and on the job. This topic has been covered countless times but what makes End Of Watch different – and better – then many of its predecessors is that it holds realism as its number one priority. This is one of the most realistic portrayals of police life ever put to celluloid. The day to day lives of these two best friends are shown in a format that is both convincing and horrifying. It doesn't flinch away when showing the disturbing aspects of this high pressure career.Using everyday video sources (chest mounted cameras, vehicle cameras, P.O.V angels, aerial shots from police choppers) definitely gives the film an unprecedented level of proximity to cops in the line of duty. Unfortunately, this format doesn't always work. Some chaotic scenes become a little bit confusing when the camera is constantly changing from first person shots to third person angles. But for the most-part it works well.Gyllenhaal and Peña provide us with two highly believable characters and their chemistry is palpable. Whether they're talking about the women in their lives or having a friendly argument about racial stereotypes, these two actors ensure that we stick with their characters through every step of the way. Gyllenhaal continues to solidify himself as one of the best actors around and Peña delivers one of his best performances to date.It's got a great script and a focused story that is handled confidently and told well. David Ayer has crafted an intense, hard hitting drama that benefits from the two excellent performances by the two leads.",gt-thereelword14,November/2012,9, Well handled and Hard hitting,1,"[hard, tell, david, ayer, grow, mean, street, south, central, los, angeles, training, day, fast, furious, dark, blue, showcase, passion, write, screenplay, street, role, police, officer, play, two, film, director, harsh, time, street, king, show, could, also, direct, hard, hit, drama, depict, underbelly, police, force, end, watch, mark, ayer, second, film, writer, gyllenhaal, michael, peña, star, two, young, officer, los, angeles, police, department, use, home, footage, format, filmmaking, end, watch, show, u, ups, down, two, young, officer, work, love, fight, street, los, term, subject, matter, film, cover, anything, really, different, cop, deal, issue, home, job, topic, cover, countless, time, make, end, ...]","[it, is, not hard, to, tell, that, david ayer, grew, up, on, the mean streets, of, south central, los angeles, training day, fast, the furious, dark blue, s.w.a.t., showcase, his passion, for, writing, screenplays, about, these streets, the role, that, police officers, play, in, them, his two films, as, director, harsh times, street kings, showed, that, he, could, also direct hard hitting dramas, depicting, the underbelly, of, the l.a. and the police force, end, watch, marks, ayer, second film, as, both writer, director.jake gyllenhaal, michael peña star, as, a two young officers, in, the los angeles, police department, using, home footage, format, of, filmmaking, end, watch shows, us the ups, downs, of, these two young officers, as, they, work, love and fight, in, the streets, of, los angeles.in terms, of, subject, matter, this film, does not cover, anything, really different, its, about, cops, dealing, with, their issues, at, home, on, the job, this topic, has been covered, countless times, makes, ...]",70.36101730217797,-3.9807271534413,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,3,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.778409090909091,176,237,hard david ayer grew mean streets south central los angeles training day fast furious dark blue w showcase passion writing screenplays streets role police officers play films director harsh times street kings showed could direct hard hitting dramas depicting underbelly l police force end watch marks ayers second film writer director jake gyllenhaal michael peña star young officers los angeles police department using home footage format filmmaking end watch shows us ups downs young officers work love fight streets los angeles terms subject matter film cover anything really different cops dealing issues home job topic covered countless times makes end watch different – better – many predecessors holds realism number priority realistic portrayals police life ever put celluloid day day lives best friends shown format convincing horrifying flinch away showing disturbing aspects high pressure career using everyday video sources chest mounted cameras vehicle cameras p v angels aerial shots police choppers definitely gives film unprecedented level proximity cops line duty unfortunately format always work chaotic scenes become little bit confusing camera constantly changing first person shots third person angles part works well gyllenhaal peña provide us highly believable characters chemistry palpable whether talking women lives friendly argument racial stereotypes actors ensure stick characters every step way gyllenhaal continues solidify best actors around peña delivers best performances date got great script focused story handled confidently told well david ayer crafted intense hard hitting drama benefits excellent performances leads,0.1309090909090909,0.5322537878787877,1
End of Watch (2012) - IMDb,"""End of Watch"" is a police drama film written and directed by David Ayer, who has worked on a number of police-related movies in the past as either the writer, director, or both, including ""S.W.A.T"" and ""Street Kings"". The film stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena as two LAPD officers and focuses on their day-to-day work as police officers and their personal lives. The film does not seem to know what it is in its method of filming. There are numerous times when the scene is shown through a multitude of different cameras, but then there are scenes where the angle would be impossible for there to be a camera. A scene I will use as an example is when the gang members are in their car. One gang member has a camera and is filming them, which we see the scene unfold through. However, when a character talks to them and the camera shows the gang member holding the video camera, there are no cameras in the car that would have gotten that video. The point I am making is that the film jumps between found-footage and then regular filming at random points in scenes, which gets frustrating. The dialog in this movie has been praised by many, and while I can understand why so many people thought it was great, I thought at best it was mediocre. A lot of the street talk was cliché and stereotypical, as was the banter between the police officers, not Gyllenhaal and Pena, felt like it came from someone who didn't know how people joked around with one another. This is also one of only three movies, the other two being the 2005 ""Assault on Precinct 13"" and the recent movie ""Sex Tape"" where I have to complain about the swearing in the dialog. Now, I have no problem with swearing, but in this movie, I felt like it got worked into every other sentence because it was supposed to make the dialog feel more realistic. Now, to Ayer's credit, there are some scenes with very good use of dialog, especially at the funeral scene and the last scene of the movie. The single line used during the funeral said everything that needed to be said without going overboard, and the last scene of the movie felt like one person telling a funny story.One thing I will give credit for was the acting in this movie. Gyllenhaal and Pena had very good chemistry and worked off of each other well. Anna Kendrick also did a very good job. I'm actually surprised none of these actors were nominated for Academy Awards for their work in this movie.Even with the acting, though, the film is still bogged down with problems, deriving heavily from the camera work and dialog. The idea of following around two officers in their day-to-day lives including their police work and personal lives is an interesting idea, and I think it could be pulled off with a better script and less of the found- footage aspect of the camera work.",TheSeaLion1,October/2014,5," Good premise and acting, but ultimately bogged down",0,"[end, watch, police, drama, film, write, direct, david, ayer, work, number, movie, past, either, writer, director, include, street, king, film, star, jake, gyllenhaal, michael, pena, two, lapd, officer, focus, work, police, officer, personal, life, film, seem, know, method, film, numerous, time, scene, show, multitude, different, camera, scene, angle, would, impossible, camera, scene, use, example, gang, member, car, one, gang, member, camera, film, see, scene, unfold, however, character, talk, camera, show, gang, member, hold, video, camera, camera, car, would, gotten, video, point, make, film, jump, regular, film, random, point, scene, get, frustrate, dialog, movie, praise, many, understand, many, people, thought, great, ...]","[end, watch, is, a police drama film, written, directed, by, david ayer, has worked, on, a number, of, police-related movies, in, the past, as, either the writer, director, including, s.w.a.t, street kings, the film stars jake gyllenhaal, michael pena, as, two lapd officers, focuses, on, their day-to-day work, as, police officers and their, personal lives, the film, does not seem, to, know, it, is, in, its method, of, filming, are, numerous times, when, the scene, is shown, through, a multitude, of, different cameras, then, are, scenes, where, the angle, would be, impossible, for, to, be, a camera, a scene i, will use, as, an example, is, when, the gang members, are, in, their car, one gang member, has, a camera, is filming, them, which, we see the scene unfold, through, however, when, a character talks, to, them and the camera, shows, the gang member, holding, the video camera, are, no cameras, in, the car, would have gotten, that, video, the point i, am making is, that, the film jumps, between, ...]",62.07625478833695,21.6394806145023,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,1,0,4,3,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.613333333333332,150,244,end watch police drama film written directed david ayer worked number police related movies past either writer director including w street kings film stars jake gyllenhaal michael pena lapd officers focuses day day work police officers personal lives film seem know method filming numerous times scene shown multitude different cameras scenes angle would impossible camera scene use example gang members car gang member camera filming scene unfold however character talks camera shows gang member holding video camera cameras car would gotten video point making film jumps found footage regular filming random points scenes gets frustrating dialog movie praised many understand many people thought great thought best mediocre lot street talk cliché stereotypical banter police officers gyllenhaal pena felt like came someone know people joked around another movies 2005 assault precinct 13 recent movie sex tape complain swearing dialog problem swearing movie felt like got worked every sentence supposed dialog feel realistic ayers credit scenes good use dialog especially funeral scene last scene movie single line used funeral said everything needed said without going overboard last scene movie felt like person telling funny story thing give credit acting movie gyllenhaal pena good chemistry worked well anna kendrick good job actually surprised none actors nominated academy awards work movie even acting though film still bogged problems deriving heavily camera work dialog idea following around officers day day lives including police work personal lives interesting idea think could pulled better script less found footage aspect camera work,0.08462585034013606,0.46498691784406065,1
Enter the Dragon (1973) - IMDb,"In the years since his bizarre and tragic death, martial arts legend and master Bruce Lee has become a sort of icon within the Kung-fu movie circuit.The last film that he completed before his death, 1973's ""Enter the Dragon,"" has become not only a masterful showcase for Lee's talents (both fighting and acting), but in the 31 years since its release has become perhaps the definitive martial arts movie of all time.Lee, in his first and last English-speaking performance, stars as a martial arts expert who is recruited by the British government to infiltrate an island fortress, under the cover of being invited to a martial arts tournament, to investigate a possible slavery/drug ring led by a former nemesis of his. Indeed something is amiss at this isolated island fortress, as he discovers that his nemesis Han (Shih Kien) is the host of the tournament and is also the leader of the same gang that murdered his sister. Soon enough, Lee, together with two other martial artists, Roper (John Saxon) and Williams (Jim Kelly), go to work kicking a** everywhere until the final showdown with the murderous, one-handed villain Han in the classic ""Hall of Mirrors"" fight sequence.""Enter the Dragon,"" a joint American-Chinese production, was intended to be Bruce Lee's introduction to Western audiences, but due to his tragic death just weeks before the film's American release, we will never know what he would have been capable of here in the states. Even more tragically, his son Brandon Lee would experience a similar fate just like his father only 20 years later with ""The Crow.""There are so many classic fight scenes, which I can watch over and over without them ever becoming boring. Many of them still hold up very well, especially by 2004's standards, where fight scenes are mostly digitally enhanced or involve ""wire"" or ""Matrix-fu"" to make up for lack of actual stunt work; plus one has to remember that this film was made in 1973, in the days before wirework would become dominant in today's martial arts cinema. The ""Cavern Fight"" is probably my favorite fight sequence of all time, in any martial arts movie. Many of the fights in this movie, more specially the ones where Lee is involved, have a surreal feeling to them. He brings a kind of grace to his action scenes that have yet to be topped by any actor alive today. Lee even brings many of his own personal philosophies to this film, which makes much sense and perhaps help to understand some of the more philosophical elements to the story. But more than anything, this was Bruce Lee's entrée to Americans; many people, including myself, were introduced to martial arts cinema through ""Enter the Dragon.""There are also several cameos made by future martial arts stars that would eventually reach stardom, most notably Jackie Chan (as a henchman during the ""Cavern Fight"" sequence who has his neck broken by Lee) and Sammo Hung (as Lee's sparring partner in the opening fight sequence).I could go on and on about what makes this movie immortal, but I feel I should let you see what makes it great.

Enter the Dragon (1973) - IMDb,"Enter the Dragon starts as a Shalolin martial arts expert named Lee (co-producer Bruce Lee) is contacted by American secret service agent guy Braithwaite (Geoffrey Weeks) who wants him to go undercover at a martial arts tournament held by international crime-lord Han (Kien Shih), Lee also learns that his younger sister committed suicide after being attacked by Han's bodyguard Oharra (Robert Wall). Lee decides he can not only help rid the world of a vicious crime-lord but avenge the death of his sister, a sort of 'kill two birds with one stone' situation which he can't refuse. Lee travels to Hong Kong & then onto Han's private island where the tournament is held & he runs his criminal empire with the intention of bringing him down...This Chinese American co-production was directed by Robert Clouse & is generally regarded as a classic, personally I don't think it's deserving of such an accolade but it ain't a bad film. The script by Michael Allin felt like a James Bond flick to me, a secret undercover guy sent in to stop some crime lord who owns his own private island with a secret underground base, he has interchangeable metal hands just like Joseph Wiseman in Dr. No (1963) & he also carries around & strokes a fluffy white cat just like Blofeld in the Bond films! The main bad guy also has a few henchmen including one with a distinctive scar. I suppose the main difference is that Enter the Dragon is far more violent than any Bond film with Bruce Lee's martial arts skills defeating all on comers. In fact it gets pretty boring in the sense that Lee literally kicks & punches everyone out with one hit & no-one can even hit him once. It becomes a precession where you know Lee is going to knock everyone out, the only interest is how he does it either with a punch, a kick or a pair of nun-chucks. I don't really like martial arts films that much & if I want a spy thriller I'll watch a James Bond film & to me Enter the Dragon is some strange mixture of the two which provides decent entertainment & is quite fun but ultimately didn't do much for me. Also how did anyone know that Lee's sister had committed suicide? The only other person in the room was Han's bodyguard Oharra & since Lee's sister killed herself how did anyone else find out? The guy who told Lee was knocked out earlier on by Oharra, answers on a postcard please...Director Clouse does alright but it's Bruce Lee who is credited with the fight direction & choreography, the fights look good & are pretty violent & if your a fan of Lee then you will love this. The climax set in a room of mirrors, according to the IMDb over 8,000 mirrors were used, is quite a disorientating & imaginative sequence. Enter the Dragon was one of only two American films Bruce Lee appeared in which used his real voice, sadly Lee died in Hong Kong three weeks before the films premiere. The film was shot without sound & all dialogue & sound effects were added in post production, it's very noticeable as well. For all you foot fetishists there is a trampling scene of a barefoot woman standing & walking on a mans back.With a supposed budget of about $850,000 this didn't have a huge budget by any stretch of the imagination, it's reasonably well made although the fact it's dubbed throughout is painfully obvious. The acting is OK but I find it hard to take actor John Saxon as a martial arts expert seriously.Enter the Dragon is an OK film, it passes 100 odd minutes painlessly enough.

Eragon (2006) - IMDb,"The movie follows nothing of the book's plot line. I think someone read like maybe ten chapters of the Eragon book and decided to make the movie. If they decide to make Eldest (The sequel to Eragon) it would be nothing like the book because they have changed too many things in this movie to carry the plot correctly. The plot of the movie shares nothing with the book and the characters (the ones they actually decided to add) share no similarities to the book's idea of them. The storyline used in the movie could have possibly been acceptable if it hadn't had such bad writing. The lines were mediocre and no one other than Brom, Eragon and Saphira had ten lines. Murtagh had like eight or nine lines through the whole movie, Nasuada and Ajihad had like two or three (and Nasuada doesn't say who she is) and Hrothgar had maybe one or two lines. They completely rushed the movie too quickly. Unless you read the book, you have no idea how Eragon learns to use magic and are left in the dark about most things. The actors did the best job they could with the horrid lines they were given to read. The special effects were great except that Saphira isn't supposed to have feathers. What dragon has feathers? Christopher Paolini says like fifty times in the book that Saphira's wings are a thin membrane. Also that Eragon is fifteen, not seventeen. Every problem comes back to the horrid writing.

Eragon (2006) - IMDb,"I tell my students to call it as they see it. If someone would be crushed by a scathing review, so be it. These Hollywood ""hotshots' need to get the hint that the public expectations for a true representation of a best-selling novel are more important that their ""artistic vision."" And when I say ""artistic vision,"" I mean stupidity and downright ignorance. Paolini's Eragon did not sell the way it did because it was merely some pulp fiction about a dragon; rather, it sold because it has a strong storyline, compelling characters, and timeless message. Not to mention that it was written by a 16 year-old boy.The most egregious evils lay within the following three reasons. First, as it is, the entire film is told as exposition. Perhaps this was done purposefully; after all, this is the first installment of a trilogy. However, it should be a complete story regardless. The writer tells the viewer what is going on, rather than showing the viewer what is supposed to happen. It's like writing a paragraph with only statements and leaving out the 3-5 sentences of elaboration for each. It is the worst kind of highlight paper. Truly by the end of the film, you are only waiting for the story to begin. But honestly, by the end of the movie, you just want to be put out of your misery. Second, the characters are static and boring. The viewer gets no sense of emotional depth to any of the characters. By limiting the character development, the trilogy itself is severely limited. By the time the film reached the final battle scene, instead of empathizing with the characters, I laughed at them. The music told me that I should feel excitement, frustration, and even sadness, but all I could do was laugh. The laughter was uncomfortable and verging on hysteria (I was deeply wounded by this film), but it was laughter nonetheless. For example, when Eragon wakes after the final battle is won, he looks upon Murtagh's friendly and sympathetic countenance. Eragon asks if Saphira is all right and Murtagh replies, ""Some friends can never be replaced"" Leading the viewer to think that Saphira may be dead. Eragon is clearly distraught, and at this point, as a viewer, you should be crying. But in a whirlwind, Saphira appears, and Murtagh happily proclaims something like, ""But luckily, they don't have to!"" And at that point, I started laughing. A loud, raucous laugh came out of me and I had no control over it. I thought, ""Gee, that Murtagh! He sure is a practical joker- he almost had me there!"" Because, you know, that's what pals do: they pretend that their friend's best friend has died, and then they can have a good laugh over it. Ha ha! Yeah, right. The viewer has no sense of the camaraderie between these characters because at the end of the film, we still don't even really know who they are, much less have a sense of their relationship to one another. Third, as a result of the previous two reasons, the story has no message worth telling. The novel is infused with themes about friendship, tolerance, caring, and justice; however, each becomes lost in this nightmare that Fang-who-ever had wrought. It is the most severe of all sins, as this film will be more widely accessible and distribute than the novel itself. For all those who walk out of the theater thinking this movie was good, whether or not they have read the novel, they are being deceived. They are being deceived into thinking that this garbage is all that this novel is or could be. With The Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson proved that a significant novel with a clearly defined fantasy world can be made with thoughtfulness, grace, and beauty. Eragon, the movie, contains none of those ideals. With a poorly written script by Peter Buchman, widely known for his work on War Magician and Jurrasic Park 3 (Did anyone even see that?), and slipshod production values, the film falls flat on it's face. All good stories leave the reader with something to think about, but this one just left me thinking, ""I paid $9 for this?""True, the novel is a significant work that should be made into a film. However, I can't see how, in the universe that has been created by the filmmakers, that the full trilogy can be told with any vestige of the original story arc. What this Fangmeier moron has done is a true disservice to Paolini, the Inheritance trilogy, the fans and general public, and most significantly, himself. This is his directorial debut, and it is a pathetic interpretation. Something amazing could have been done here. But what I saw was a lazy and wretched re- working of a story that should have simply been told as it was written. For this, as a teacher, I must give Stefen What's-his-name and his entire production crew an F because his work was off-topic and irrelevant.",mrs-mcmanus20,December/2006,1, Let's call it as we see it.,0,"[tell, student, call, see, someone, would, crush, scathing, review, hollywood, hotshot, need, get, hint, public, expectation, true, representation, novel, important, artistic, vision, say, artistic, vision, mean, stupidity, downright, ignorance, paolini, eragon, sell, way, merely, pulp, fiction, dragon, rather, sell, strong, storyline, compelling, character, timeless, message, mention, write, egregious, evil, lay, within, follow, three, reason, first, entire, film, told, exposition, perhaps, do, purposefully, first, installment, trilogy, however, complete, story, regardless, writer, tell, viewer, go, rather, show, viewer, suppose, happen, like, write, paragraph, statement, leave, sentence, elaboration, bad, kind, highlight, paper, truly, end, film, wait, story, begin, honestly, end, movie, want, put, ...]","[i tell my students, to, call, it, as, they, see, it, if, someone, would be crushed, by, a scathing review, so be, it, these hollywood, hotshots, need, to, get, the hint, that, the public expectations, for, a true representation, of, a best-selling novel, are, more important, that, their, artistic vision, when, i, say, artistic vision, i mean stupidity and downright ignorance, paolini, eragon, did not sell, the way it, did, because, it, was, merely, some pulp fiction, about, a dragon, rather, it, sold, because, it, has, a strong storyline, compelling characters, timeless message, not, to, mention, that, it, was written, by, a 16 year-old boy.the most egregious evils, lay, within, following, three reasons, first, as, it, is, the entire film, is told, as, exposition, perhaps, was done, purposefully, after, is, the first installment, of, a trilogy, however, it, should be, a complete story, regardless, the writer, tells, the viewer, is going, on, rather, than, showing, the viewer, ...]",247.5644464058256,-6.9859414082351075,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,1,2,1,4,2,3,1,0,1,2,0,6.178181818181818,275,384,students call someone would crushed scathing review hollywood hotshots need hint public expectations true representation best selling novel important artistic vision artistic vision mean stupidity downright ignorance paolinis eragon sell way merely pulp fiction dragon rather sold strong storyline compelling characters timeless message mention written 16 year old boy egregious evils lay within following reasons first entire film told exposition perhaps done purposefully first installment trilogy however complete story regardless writer tells viewer going rather showing viewer supposed happen like writing paragraph statements leaving 3 5 sentences elaboration worst kind highlight paper truly end film waiting story begin honestly end movie want put misery second characters static boring viewer gets sense emotional depth characters limiting character development trilogy severely limited time film reached final battle scene instead empathizing characters laughed music told feel excitement frustration even sadness could laugh laughter uncomfortable verging hysteria deeply wounded film laughter nonetheless example eragon wakes final battle looks upon murtaghs friendly sympathetic countenance eragon asks saphira right murtagh replies friends never replaced leading viewer think saphira may dead eragon clearly distraught point viewer crying whirlwind saphira appears murtagh happily proclaims something like luckily point started laughing loud raucous laugh came control thought gee murtagh sure practical joker almost know pals pretend friends best friend died good laugh ha ha yeah right viewer sense camaraderie characters end film still even really know much less sense relationship another third result previous reasons story message worth telling novel infused themes friendship tolerance caring justice however becomes lost nightmare fang ever wrought severe sins film widely accessible distribute novel walk theater thinking movie good whether read novel deceived deceived thinking garbage novel could lord rings peter jackson proved significant novel clearly defined fantasy world made thoughtfulness grace beauty eragon movie contains none ideals poorly written script peter buchman widely known work war magician jurrasic park 3 anyone even slipshod production values film falls flat face good stories leave reader something think left thinking paid 9 true novel significant work made film however universe created filmmakers full trilogy told vestige original story arc fangmeier moron done true disservice paolini inheritance trilogy fans general public significantly directorial debut pathetic interpretation something amazing could done saw lazy wretched working story simply told written teacher must give stefen name entire production crew f work topic irrelevant,0.1052884615384615,0.575719881969882,1

Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone (2007) - IMDb,"I really don't recommend this movie. The only reason I can see that someone would actually recommend this movie is if they watched the original series (which I haven't seen because I can't find it anywhere in the US) and just wanted to see more? Other reviews on here are saying that this movie is as good as and better than the original series, and if that is true then I really don't want to try to find the original series. Animation - I've noticed a lot that people who don't watch anime are more likely to watch anime movies vs anime tv shows. I think this is because movies are sometimes more accessible for people to find and watch. A consequence of this is that people will end up watching one or two anime movies with very poor animation, and then think that that is the standard for anime and call it beautiful. This anime is not ""beautiful"" (a word in nearly every positive review on this site). There are a few nice shots, but nothing above average, and honestly a lot of it just looks generic and borderline bad. The actual animation isn't very good either. I've seen better animation in cheaply made tv shows. I've even seen better animation in much older feature length animes, in case someone wants to bring up that argument where the reason why the animation wasn't that good is because ""its old."" This anime was made in 2007. Anime movies have been around for much longer.Plot/Characters - This movie is really boring. Probably because there is no plot, no character development, and no world building. This movie is just a collection of scenes with barely anything connecting them. Almost nothing about how this world works is ever established, and nothing about the characters is developed. Overall, this movie is just a confusing collection of fight scenes and visual noise. Honestly I would've preferred exposition dumps over this disjointed mess.Sound - Yes, I watched with the Japanese dub. Yes, it was bad. I can't recall much music (I literally just watched it before writing this review), but there is a lot of stock sound effects. Also the voice acting was bad. Not that I blame the actors, I wouldn't have known how to act if I was presented a horrible script like that.",invisibleunicornninja11,October/2018,4, BORING,0,"[really, recommend, movie, reason, see, someone, would, actually, recommend, movie, watch, original, series, see, find, anywhere, us, want, see, review, say, movie, good, better, original, series, true, really, want, try, find, original, series, animation, notice, lot, people, watch, anime, likely, watch, anime, movie, v, anime, tv, show, think, movie, sometimes, accessible, people, find, watch, consequence, people, end, watch, one, two, anime, movie, poor, animation, think, standard, anime, call, beautiful, anime, beautiful, word, nearly, every, positive, review, site, nice, shot, nothing, average, honestly, lot, look, generic, borderline, bad, actual, animation, good, either, see, better, animation, cheaply, make, tv, show, even, see, ...]","[i, really do not recommend, this movie, the only reason i, can see, that, someone, would actually recommend, this movie, is, if, they, watched, the original series, i have not seen, because, i, cannot find, it, anywhere, in, the us, just wanted, to, see, more, other reviews, on, here are saying, that, this movie, is, as good, as, better, than, the original series, if, is, true then i, really do not want, to, try, to, find, the original series, animation, i, have noticed, a lot, that, people, do not watch, anime, are, more likely, to, watch, anime movies vs anime tv shows, i, think, is, because, movies, are, sometimes more accessible, for, people, to, find, watch, a consequence, of, is, that, people, will end, up, watching, one or two anime movies, with, very poor animation, then think, that, is, the standard, for, anime, call, it, beautiful, this anime, is, not, beautiful, a word, in, nearly, every positive review, on, ...]",-6.4239756256613365,22.47655136976717,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,5.8392857142857135,112,187,really recommend movie reason someone would actually recommend movie watched original series seen anywhere us wanted reviews saying movie good better original series true really want original series animation noticed lot people watch anime likely watch anime movies vs anime tv shows think movies sometimes accessible people watch consequence people end watching anime movies poor animation think standard anime call beautiful anime beautiful word nearly every positive review site nice shots nothing average honestly lot looks generic borderline bad actual animation good either seen better animation cheaply made tv shows even seen better animation much older feature length animes case someone wants bring argument reason animation good old anime made 2007 anime movies around much longer plot characters movie really boring probably plot character development world building movie collection scenes barely anything connecting almost nothing world works ever established nothing characters developed overall movie confusing collection fight scenes visual noise honestly would preferred exposition dumps disjointed mess sound yes watched japanese dub yes bad recall much music literally watched writing review lot stock sound effects voice acting bad blame actors would known act presented horrible script like,0.1410195707070707,0.46726641414141407,1
Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance (2009) - IMDb,"It's been a long wait, but better late than never I'd say. One of the classic mecha science fiction anime now undergoing a revamp of its own, and despite not having much background knowledge of where the series has headed toward, I still found this installment engaging enough to leave me wanting more especially since it ended on a cliffhanger of sorts, even though it's yet another long wait before the third film hit the screens over here.Evangelion continues where we last left off in its cinematic version, and the Earth is now under protection by the EVA robots around the world, still piloted by children. There are plans now underway to be more humane though, in piloting the EVAs like unmanned drones from afar, thus keeping the kids out of harm's way. But then there are other plans brewing at sinister levels, which only get hinted at here, clearly sowing the seeds in this installment for something more to come in the future films.Elements from the earlier film have become staple, and repeated, such as the cheeky way the female characters always get portrayed in teasing the audience / fanboys with various states of dress / near wardrobe malfunction, and hey, besides lead character Shinji Ikari (voiced by Megumi Ogata), every one of his peer pilot seem to be female, and in the opening we're introduced to the pilot for EVA No 5 to start off the film literally with a bang, and EVA No 2's pilot Asuka Langley Shikinami (Yuko Miyamura) in her bright red robot and uniform, in an instant confirming the suspicion that here's one hot chili who isn't afraid to speak her mind. I like this feisty character, who brings a breath of fresh air from the quiet Rei Ayanami (Megumi Hayashibara) and Shinji's pessimism. Other elements would include the countless religious imagery, which is now more in-your-face, and I suppose it should all make sense once the final film rolls around.The narrative found perfect balance to go a little deeper into the motivation of the various characters, though the kid pilots leave more room as intended for future growth, since Rei is a quiet enigma, Shinji still being the reluctant hero, and Asuka the live-wire who doesn't mince her words, even if criticizing her Japanese counterparts quite pointedly and in some ways, offensively too. A large chunk of the story got devoted to a suggestion of a love triangle that didn't manage to play itself out due to the constant alien threat, but got to a point enough to affect the events that follow, and to make them a sledgehammer for emotions. Then there's the action sequences, which are still as spectacular. The Angels' designs get weirder, and their attack more powerful of course, though the EVAs have a few more tricks up their sleeves, brought about by really pushing the envelope beyond what has so far been permissible. With humans at the helm of technology, we are always in control and can add that aspect of humanity without allowing technology itself from going berserk. This gets explored and discussed somewhat, especially when a dummy module gets its field day when called upon to override some human inaction, and I assure you your jaw will drop and how enemies get pulverized, which is something which I least expected, in an action-packed, yet moving scene which will get you all riled up. Then again this shows how important it is to have a human mind in control, over something else which dictates its actions through set rules, and executed without a soul of thought.As a follow up film, this one lived up to the potential set by its predecessor, and expanded upon that universe with more Evangelion protocols, new and improved mecha capabilities, and characters you feel for, while still keeping a lid on the intrigue posed by the organizations NERV and Seele. No prior knowledge of the earlier film is required, though you would be better off to know some basics to enjoy the film a lot more.

Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance (2009) - IMDb,"Let me start by saying that I consider the original Evangelion show as one of the best animes ever made. One thing in particular made it special: the characters.Back then we got to spend a great deal of time with Shinji a teenager with a huge responsibility on his shoulders who does not carry it easily like an action hero stereotype but is rather deeply hurt by it and by his relationship with his father. I look at the Shinji in this movie and yes, he does seem a bit shy and... but wait! there's a big action sequence coming up! Damn does the new angel design look cool! Oh yes, where were we? The characters... well in the original series there was that totally weird blue haired girl the likes of which we'd never seen in another anime before. Rei was such an enigma, you had to guess if she was even human or not. Thankfully this is fixed now and yes, she is a bit strange... but wait! Big action sequence coming through! 10 minutes of gorgeous explosions and punches! Yay, this is amazing!! So back to Rei.. now she is cooking for a party. Isn't this lovely, that's more how a young girl should behave. Not like that Asuka who is now in an aggressive mood. Always. In the original show she used to be a lot more likable, maybe because we could see a more childish side of her. Now she's this annoying genius who feels lonely and... But wait another super-cool fight is starting after this 38th panty shot! Wow it's our new character! She's great and she's... umm...she's like...well... i don't really know, but she kicks ass!!

Everly (2014) - IMDb,"Greetings again from the darkness. If only drive-in theaters were still the weekend hang-out of choice for teenage boys, this latest from director Joe Lynch would be the perfect second feature after some horror or slasher designed to generate oohs and ahhs through gross-outs (elevators and grenades are not a good mix).After beginning with its most unsettling scene – gang abuse of a female (fortunately via black screen and sound effects) - the rest of the film plays just like an ultra-violent, hyper-speed video game. The two main distinctions here are that all of the action takes place inside a loft apartment, and the lead character is played by Salma Hayek. Having appeared in Desperado and From Dusk Til Dawn, Ms. Hayek is no stranger to wild action sequences, but here she carries every carnage-filled scene  all while slinking around in a silk slip or her favorite yoga pants.Gun, knives, swords, grenades, chemicals and various other implements of destruction are brandished by Hayek, masked killers, greedy hookers, a SWAT team, and Hayek's ex-pimp/kidnapper. We even get a character called ""The Sadist"" (Togo Igawa) in one of the most straight-forward character names in movie history. There is even an attack dog named Bonzai that is well-trained in everything except the difference between a ball and a grenade. And therein lies the saving grace here  the movie has some absurd humor that prevents the ultimate tone of dread by such films as Saw. The humor isn't so much clever as it is outrageous  and it helps offset the gruesome and blood-filled body count (at least 20 in the first 20 minutes!).Director Joe Lynch is more comfortable with horror films than action films, but it's clear he has a love with B-movies, and he is fortunate enough to have Salma Hayek front and center. The only way to watch this is with your brain shifted to neutral. The level of ridiculous is off the scale and includes too many ""that makes no sense"" moments to recap here. On top of all that, the action occurs around Christmas, and use of six traditional Christmas songs adds to the twisted humor that will probably keep you tuned in, despite your knowing better.",ferguson-628,January/2015,4, That's a lot of Dead ...,0,,,52.65810420253354,-22.622565614852384,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,1,4,0,5,0,4,5.538461538461538,182,212,greetings darkness drive theaters still weekend hang choice teenage boys latest director joe lynch would perfect second feature horror slasher designed generate oohs ahhs gross outs elevators grenades good mix beginning unsettling scene – gang abuse female fortunately via black screen sound effects rest film plays like ultra violent hyper speed video game main distinctions action takes place inside loft apartment lead character played salma hayek appeared desperado dusk til dawn ms hayek stranger wild action sequences carries every carnage filled scene slinking around silk slip favorite yoga pants gun knives swords grenades chemicals various implements destruction brandished hayek masked killers greedy hookers swat team hayeks ex pimp kidnapper even character called sadist togo igawa straight forward character names movie history even attack dog named bonzai well trained everything except difference ball grenade therein lies saving grace movie absurd humor prevents ultimate tone dread films saw humor much clever outrageous helps offset gruesome blood filled body count least 20 first 20 minutes director joe lynch comfortable horror films action films clear love b movies fortunate enough salma hayek front center way watch brain shifted neutral level ridiculous scale includes many makes sense moments recap top action occurs around christmas use traditional christmas songs adds twisted humor probably keep tuned despite knowing better,0.06705426356589149,0.5589147286821706,1
Fantastic Four (2015) - IMDb,"Fantastic Four is not your average superhero movie by today's standards. It's dark, low-key, and unexpected. I almost passed on watching this, since everyone seemed to have hated it. I'm glad I gave it a shot anyway.I'd like to borrow a quote from another reviewer here that expresses quite accurately why this movie didn't do well (even though the review was intended to be negative):""Fantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.""That about sums it up. Superhero audiences were expecting something similar to recent superhero offerings, and they didn't get it. For myself, being generally not terribly impressed with most recent superhero movies, I had a somewhat different reaction. There have been a couple standouts, like Batman Begins and Iron Man, but on the whole most seem like forgettable, disposable eye candy. If taken as a standalone flick, independent of any expectation, this is a decent movie. It's for the most part well-paced, well-acted, the effects are convincing without being overdone, and it's even well-written, for the most part. What it is not, is ""big"". And people were expecting big, of course. Rather than its characters shown becoming celebrities with the world watching, the press eating them up, and displaying spectacles for the public that destroy city property, these kids spin a rather ""small"" tale that occurs primarily in secret.I give this a seven out of ten, but threw in an extra star to offset (just a little bit) the unfair slap this movie got due to viewer tastes being, I feel, ruined by bloated Hollywood treatment of recent superhero adaptations.",equazcion3,October/2015,8," I liked it, but I can see why others didn't",1,"[fantastic, four, average, superhero, movie, today, standard, dark, unexpected, almost, pass, watch, since, everyone, seem, hat, glad, give, shot, would, like, borrow, quote, another, reviewer, express, quite, accurately, movie, well, even, though, review, intend, negative, fantastic, four, film, much, time, place, today, market, superhero, movie, ten, fifteen, year, ago, studio, might, able, get, away, today, audience, like, entertain, competition, offering, much, excitement, see, audience, take, sum, superhero, audience, expect, something, similar, recent, superhero, offering, get, generally, terribly, impress, recent, superhero, movie, somewhat, different, reaction, couple, standouts, like, batman, begin, iron, man, whole, seem, like, forgettable, disposable, eye, candy, take, standalone, ...]","[fantastic, is, not, your, average superhero movie, by, today, standards, it, is, dark, low-key, unexpected, i, almost passed, on, watching, since, everyone, seemed, to, have hated, it, i, am, glad i, gave, it a shot, would like, to, borrow, quote, from, another reviewer, here, expresses, quite accurately why, this movie, did not do, well, even, though, the review, was intended, to, be, negative):""fantastic, is, a film, very much, out of, time and place, in, today, market, of, superhero movies, ten or fifteen years, ago, a studio, might have been, able, to, get, away, with, it but not today, audiences, like, to, be entertained, with, the competition offering, much more excitement, i, do not see, audiences, taking, to, at, all.""that, about, sums it, up, superhero audiences, were expecting, something, similar, to, recent, superhero offerings, they, did not get, it, for, myself, being generally not terribly impressed, with, most recent superhero movies, i, ...]",-12.310170460896302,-5.189021440221347,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,5.9848484848484835,132,167,fantastic average superhero movie todays standards dark low key unexpected almost passed watching since everyone seemed hated glad gave shot anyway would like borrow quote another reviewer expresses quite accurately movie well even though review intended negative fantastic film much time place todays market superhero movies ten fifteen years ago studio might able away today audiences like entertained competition offering much excitement audiences taking sums superhero audiences expecting something similar recent superhero offerings generally terribly impressed recent superhero movies somewhat different reaction couple standouts like batman begins iron man whole seem like forgettable disposable eye candy taken standalone flick independent expectation decent movie part well paced well acted effects convincing without overdone even well written part big people expecting big course rather characters shown becoming celebrities world watching press eating displaying spectacles public destroy city property kids spin rather small tale occurs primarily secret give ten threw extra star offset little bit unfair slap movie got due viewer tastes feel ruined bloated hollywood treatment recent superhero adaptations,0.03563596491228071,0.48135964912280704,1
Fantastic Four (2015) - IMDb,"Based on a scientific project that Reed Richards (Miles Teller) has been developing (which can transfer matter from one dimension to another) the Fantastic Four use themselves as Guinea Pigs in order to transfer themselves to another dimension (in the belief that there is something in this other worldly dimension that will benefit their own planet). However, something goes wrong for our foursome during the transportation process and they end up with drastic physical transformations (some which are much more noticeable than others). Worse still, they tried and failed to save Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and leave him behind believing him to be dead. Later on, a team go back to the other dimension and discover that Victor is still alive and bring him back to Earth in order to assess his condition. But Victor has no intention of staying on Earth and is determined to create a new world in this other dimension and will stop at nothing to achieve his objective. Victor has also suffered a physical transformation, but he has become much stronger and more powerful than his former friends and the Fantastic Four find that they must work together to try to stop him from carrying out his evil plans.The film opens up with some promise whereby we're given an insight into how our illustrious foursome ended up becoming the formidable team that we saw in the earlier films. Despite a fairly promising beginning though this reboot completely fails to bring about a lot of the magic that we witnessed in the 2005 version of this film.A big problem for me lay with the tone of the film; firstly it takes itself WAY too seriously and as a result it made the film quite boring to watch. When watching this it felt like I was watching a science documentary (with all its wordy geeky exposition) rather than what should be a fun comic book type movie. This brings me on to my next point 'What fun'? In the 2005 film (and the 2007 film as well) there was much more in the way of camaraderie between the cast making the film much more fun to watch. As a villain Von Doom isn't particularly well-developed here and I felt his motivations for world-domination were a little sketchy here - I criticised Von Doom's motivations in the original film, but compared to his motivations here they now seem more plausible in retrospect.I appreciate that this is a reboot and therefore the filmmaker's are trying to put their own stamp on things (presumably that explains why Johnny Storm is black in this film and also explains why their powers have been attained in a different manner to the original film). The problem with this reboot is that they've failed to do anything to improve on the original film; the story isn't as interesting, the characters are much weaker and are poorly developed, there is no real exploration of their super powers (this was a big thing in the previous films and made sense as they were a big life-changing aspect for the foursome), but here they just kind of have the super powers and then that's it - off to destroy Victor Von Doom. The only real super power that is explored is that of The Thing and even that super power is exploited in a rather lame way.The cast are another big problem with this film as they totally failed to engage with me (as well as each other); Miles Teller is really bland as Reed Richards (even more bland than Ioan Gruffudd was in the original films) which is surprising as he put in a very good performance in Whiplash 2 years ago. Kate Mara is very pretty, but she's terrible in this film (again probably worse than Alba was in the original films). Michael B Jordan tries his best as Johnny Storm, but he lacks the charisma that Evans brought to the role in the original films and as a result suffers badly in comparison. The Thing for me is probably the best character in the film, but he lacks the touching back story that we lay witness to in the original film and again suffers from not being developed sufficiently enough to make me really care about him here.The ending is also poor and lacks any kind of intensity and tension and has the Fantastic Four doing 'the obvious' to wrap the film up.All in all it's a very disappointing film where the serious tone is perhaps a bigger enemy to the film than Doctor Doom. It's big and bloated, but it's also boring, and lacking in both fun and imagination. I'd recommend giving it a wide berth.",jimbo-53-18651123,June/2016,1, A pointless reboot which fails to improve on the original film in almost every manner possible,0,"[base, scientific, project, reed, richards, mile, teller, develop, transfer, matter, one, dimension, another, fantastic, four, use, guinea, pig, order, transfer, another, dimension, belief, something, worldly, dimension, benefit, planet, however, something, go, wrong, foursome, transportation, process, end, drastic, physical, transformation, much, noticeable, others, bad, still, try, fail, save, victor, von, doom, toby, kebbell, leave, behind, believe, dead, later, team, go, back, dimension, discover, victor, still, alive, bring, back, earth, order, ass, condition, victor, intention, stay, earth, determine, create, new, world, dimension, stop, nothing, achieve, objective, victor, also, suffer, physical, transformation, become, much, strong, powerful, former, friend, fantastic, four, find, must, work, ...]","[based, on, a scientific project, that, reed richards, miles, teller, has been developing, can transfer matter, from, one dimension, to, fantastic, four use themselves, as, guinea pigs, in, order, to, transfer, themselves, to, another dimension, in, the belief, that, is something, in, this other worldly dimension, will benefit, their own planet, however, something, goes, wrong, for, our foursome, during, the transportation process, they, end, up with, drastic physical transformations, are, much more noticeable, than, others, worse still, they, tried, failed, to, save, victor von doom, toby kebbell, leave, him, behind believing, him, to, be, dead, later, on, a team go, back, to, the other dimension, discover, that, victor, is, still alive, bring, him, back, to, earth, in, order, to, assess, his condition, victor, has, no intention, of, staying, on, earth, is determined, to, create, a new world, in, this other dimension, will stop, at, nothing, to, ...]",216.5591713602617,20.57540049596113,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,3,1,1,4,1,3,1,0,1,2,0,6.157446808510637,235,373,based scientific project reed richards miles teller developing transfer matter dimension another fantastic use guinea pigs order transfer another dimension belief something worldly dimension benefit planet however something goes wrong foursome transportation process end drastic physical transformations much noticeable others worse still tried failed save victor von doom toby kebbell leave behind believing dead later team dimension discover victor still alive bring earth order assess condition victor intention staying earth determined create new world dimension stop nothing achieve objective victor suffered physical transformation become much stronger powerful former friends fantastic must work together stop carrying evil plans film opens promise whereby given insight illustrious foursome ended becoming formidable team saw earlier films despite fairly promising beginning though reboot completely fails bring lot magic witnessed 2005 version film big problem lay tone film firstly takes way seriously result made film quite boring watch watching felt like watching science documentary wordy geeky exposition rather fun comic book type movie brings next point fun 2005 film 2007 film well much way camaraderie cast making film much fun watch villain von doom particularly well developed felt motivations world domination little sketchy criticised von dooms motivations original film compared motivations seem plausible retrospect appreciate reboot therefore filmmakers trying put stamp things presumably explains johnny storm black film explains powers attained different manner original film problem reboot failed anything improve original film story interesting characters much weaker poorly developed real exploration super powers big thing previous films made sense big life changing aspect foursome kind super powers destroy victor von doom real super power explored thing even super power exploited rather lame way cast another big problem film totally failed engage well miles teller really bland reed richards even bland ioan gruffudd original films surprising put good performance whiplash 2 years ago kate mara pretty terrible film probably worse alba original films michael b jordan tries best johnny storm lacks charisma evans brought role original films result suffers badly comparison thing probably best character film lacks touching story lay witness original film suffers developed sufficiently enough really care ending poor lacks kind intensity tension fantastic obvious wrap film disappointing film serious tone perhaps bigger enemy film doctor doom big bloated boring lacking fun imagination would recommend giving wide berth,0.03812170619235838,0.502430359495577,1
Fearless (2006) - IMDb,"I've always been a fan of Jet Li since his early days, and frankly his movies and performances in them have been terrible in the last few years mainly due to his attempts to be a profitable and a more mainstream actor in the US. As a result, we were treated to ""nice"" movies like The One and Cradle to the Grave. This movie though makes up them. This was truly a gem. Not only were the action sequences spectacular, and I iterate spectacular, but the story line and acting as well as screen play was very tastefully done.

Fire Down Below (1997) - IMDb,"I have watched this several times and always find it enjoyable. There is a gallery of good actors in support like Harry Dean Stanton and Kris Kristofferson. Special mention should be made of Stephen Lang who although playing a murderous character does make one feel sorry for him. Also Marg Helgenberger gives a touching portrayal of Sarah Kellogg, ready to bloom after years of repression. The photography of the landscape is beautiful and contrasts with the story about its despoliation by illegal dumping of chemicals. This film is more about character and story. The fight scenes themselves are quite brief.
Which brings us to Steven Seagal. His bland acting style works strangely enough in complement with the other stronger actors.He does the combat OK.

Fire Down Below (1997) - IMDb,"Fire Down Below (1997): Dir: Felix Enriguez Acala / Cast: Steven Seagal, Marg Helgenberger, Harry Dean Stanton, Kris Kristofferson, Stephen Lang: One of the dumbest films that Steven Seagal ever conjured up. He plays an agent who arrives in a coal mining town to put a stop to the toxic waste that is poisoning water. He makes a few friends as well as the expected enemies who wish not to be bothered. Boring concept followed by numerous fight scenes before concluding pretty much the same way. Director Felix Enriguez Acala is working with material that has about the same value as diarrhea. Even the production is boring. Seagal spends 90% of the film in combat where he beats up dozens of people including cops. I could only shake my head as some big lout threatens him and he beats the sh*t out him in short order as well as kicking around a bunch of his buddies. In lame supporting roles is Marg Helgenberger who clings to Seagal while he beats up her abusive brother. Harry Dean Stanton is far too valuable for this sh*t. Kris Kristofferson plays the standard villain in a role that is totally beneath him. Stephen Lang plays Helgenberger's nasty abusive brother who will end up with Seagal's foot up his ass.

Fist of Legend (1994) - IMDb,"A remake of Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury, this movie gives us amazing martial arts sequences, with good plot and acting in between.The fights are spectacular. A lot of martial arts movies incorporate wonderful movements and acrobatics, designed to show off the skill and grace of the fighter. However in a life or death struggle, these sometimes seem out of place. This is a ""realistic"" martial arts movie. You almost feel yourself cringing with each hit. As the man said: ""These lads are out to hurt each other."" This is fighting in its purest, taking cue from Bruce Lee's personal style, where the aim is to defeat your opponent in the most efficient manner possible. The opening fight of the movie sets its style right away and continues to its climax.But what made this movie go above and beyond a martial arts flick is the storyline and plot. This movie deals with themes of racism, tolerance and acceptance not only between the Chinese and Japanese, but within each group as well. Here Jet Li shines in his performance. While events cause him to lose his composure and give in to his feelings, at the core you see that he is a righteous person. When he realizes the correct course of action, either by himself, or when it is pointed out by others, he does what is right. And we see the people around him learn from his behavior and they seek to emulate it. The movie also tries to present a rather fair view of both the Chinese and Japanese. Neither side is portrayed as good or evil, rather as normal human beings, running the whole spectrum from selfish to noble, from hateful to kind.

The Chinese Connection) with Bruce Lee, Jet Li lacked the grim disposition that Bruce Lee potrayed so well in Fist of Fury (rather unlike all his other rather stereotyped roles), the movie lacked the climatic ending of Fist of Fury, it lacked the love story.

For Love and Honour (2007) - IMDb,"After some glorious reviews I was very curious to watch this movie. I must say I was quite disappointed all in all, but there were some positive elements as well: Sener Sen is fantastic in his performance, very convincing and his character truly shines. But that does not save the movie. I thought the main problem was an unfortunate mix of genres, which weakened the movie: it is supposed to be a drama, but there are (mainly unintended, almost ridiculous) ""slapstick""-like scenes or moments in it, that makes it like a caricature of itself. Of course drama and comedy can be very close but I am not talking about true comedy here. Slapstick elements in such a serious piece of work just simply ruins it. Since I felt like laughing in some of the supposedly most serious moments, the drama in it did not truly catch my full attention. The homosexual character was so exaggerated (like a persiflage), sympathetic but very calculated jokes, then Devran is still talking and saying odd stuff whilst he is almost about to die, generally people have very dramatic expressions in there faces once they are shot dead (this could be slapstick, truly!) or the girl's comment about Devrans ""best male piece"" not being as big as Murats, and Devrans reaction to it (slapstick pure!) and this unfortunate mixture just took so much away from the movie. I got distracted and even noticed some minor imperfections in editing or logic of scenes(which I normally don't tend to notice). For example, Ali Osman uses Murats mobile phone to call his friend and just presses one button (like a repeat call) but it is impossible that his friends number is saved in Murats phone as he does not even know him! Karaca is seriously injured by the shooting in the bar, she is in hospital etc and suddenly the injury seems to be gone, she is back to normal!

Forbidden Planet (1956) - IMDb,"I am always so frustrated that the majority of science fiction movies are really intergalactic westerns or war dramas.  Even Star Wars which is visually brilliant, has one of its central images, a futuristic ""gang that couldn't shoot straight.""  Imagine your coming upon about 600 people with conventional weapons, most of them having an open shot, and they miss.I have read much science fiction, and wish there were more movies for the thinking person.  Forbidden Planet, one of the earliest of the genre, is still one of the very best.  The story is based on a long extinct civilization, the Krell, who created machines which could boost the intelligence of any being by quantum leaps.  Unfortunately, what they hadn't bargained for, is that the brain is a center for other thoughts than intellectual. The primitive aspect of the brain, the Id, as Freud called it, is allowed to go unchecked.  It is released in sleep, a bad dream come to corporeal existence. Walter Pigeon, Dr. Morbius, is the one who has jacked his brain to this level, and with it has built machines and defenses that keep him barely one step ahead of the horrors of the recesses of his own mind. His thoughts are creating horrors that he soon will not be able to defend.  The Krell, a much superior species, could not stop it; it destroyed them. The landing party has never been of great interest to me.  The rest of the actors are pretty interchangeable.  Ann Francis is beautiful and naive, and certainly would have produced quite a reaction in the fifties adolescent male.

Foreign Correspondent (1940) - IMDb,"In a recent viewing of my VHS copy of Foreign Correspondent, I hadn't realized how dated it was and also how silly the plot was. Not worthy of the master of suspense.Foreign Correspondent was the second film that Alfred Hitchcock made in America and it was a one shot deal for independent producer Walter Wanger. That other well known independent producer David O. Selznick got some big bucks for Hitch's services. Or maybe he saw how ridiculous the story line was for Foreign Correspondent. Hitchcock's all purpose McGuffin in this story is a person, the Dutch Foreign Minister played by Albert Basserman.The devilishly clever Nazis hatch a scheme in which they kidnap Basserman, substitute a double and assassinate the double. So after getting Basserman, what do they do? They don't spirit him away to Germany, they take him to England instead. Supposedly so that collaborator Herbert Marshall can get the text of a secret clause in a treaty the Dutch have signed with some other country not named. A little sodium pentathol in Germany would have done the trick.I think the idea was totally ridiculous and I can't believe Alfred Hitchcock didn't find it so.The purpose of this film was an attack on those in Great Britain dubbed the Cliveden set who hung out at Lady Nancy Astor's estate named Cliveden. These folks wanted peace at any price with Hitler and it's still a subject today for debate whether they were just fools or out and out traitors. Hitchcock opts for the latter. Still the film has its Hitchcockian touches his fans love so well. The chase scene through the windmill country, the climax when the Atlantic clipper with Joel McCrea, Laraine Day, George Sanders, and Herbert Marshall is shot down after war is formally declared. Even at that, I can't believe that a submarine possessed sufficient fire power to down an airliner, why didn't the airliner just raise altitude?Joel McCrea was Hitchcock's second choice after Gary Cooper turned him down. Hitchcock and McCrea got along well, he wanted to use him for later films like Saboteur, but they never worked together again.And that's a pity because Foreign Correspondent isn't Hitchcock at his best.",bkoganbing24,May/2007,5, Cliveden Set,0,"[recent, view, vhs, copy, foreign, correspondent, realize, date, also, silly, plot, worthy, master, correspondent, second, film, alfred, hitchcock, make, america, one, shot, deal, independent, producer, walter, wanger, well, know, independent, producer, david, selznick, get, big, buck, hitch, service, maybe, saw, ridiculous, story, line, foreign, correspondent, hitchcock, purpose, mcguffin, story, person, dutch, foreign, minister, played, albert, devilishly, clever, nazi, hatch, scheme, kidnap, basserman, substitute, double, assassinate, double, get, basserman, spirit, away, germany, take, england, instead, supposedly, collaborator, herbert, marshall, get, text, secret, clause, treaty, dutch, sign, country, name, little, sodium, pentathol, germany, would, do, think, idea, totally, ridiculous, believe, alfred, hitchcock, ...]","[in, a recent viewing, of, my vhs, copy, of, foreign correspondent, i, had not realized, how, dated, it, was, also how, silly, the plot, was, not, worthy, of, the master, of, suspense.foreign correspondent, was, the second film, that, alfred hitchcock, made, in, america and it, was, a one shot deal, for, independent producer walter wanger, that, other, well known, independent producer, david, o. selznick, got, some big bucks, for, hitch, services, maybe, he, saw, how, ridiculous, the story line, was, for, foreign correspondent, hitchcock, 's, all purpose mcguffin, in, this story, is, a person, the dutch, foreign minister, played, by, albert basserman.the devilishly clever nazis, hatch, a scheme, in which, they kidnap basserman, substitute, double, assassinate, the double, so, after, getting, basserman, do, they, do, they, do, not spirit him, away, to, germany, they, take, him, to, england, instead, supposedly so, that, collaborator herbert marshall, can get, the text, of, a secret clause, ...]",20.97606926095633,-5.041106896713381,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,5.886666666666668,150,195,recent viewing vhs copy foreign correspondent realized dated silly plot worthy master suspense foreign correspondent second film alfred hitchcock made america shot deal independent producer walter wanger well known independent producer david selznick got big bucks hitchs services maybe saw ridiculous story line foreign correspondent hitchcocks purpose mcguffin story person dutch foreign minister played albert basserman devilishly clever nazis hatch scheme kidnap basserman substitute double assassinate double getting basserman spirit away germany take england instead supposedly collaborator herbert marshall text secret clause treaty dutch signed country named little sodium pentathol germany would done trick think idea totally ridiculous believe alfred hitchcock purpose film attack great britain dubbed cliveden set hung lady nancy astors estate named cliveden folks wanted peace price hitler still subject today debate whether fools traitors hitchcock opts latter still film hitchcockian touches fans love well chase scene windmill country climax atlantic clipper joel mccrea laraine day george sanders herbert marshall shot war formally declared even believe submarine possessed sufficient fire power airliner airliner raise altitude joel mccrea hitchcocks second choice gary cooper turned hitchcock mccrea got along well wanted use later films like saboteur never worked together pity foreign correspondent hitchcock best,0.005709876543209876,0.3450617283950617,1
Fort Apache (1948) - IMDb,"I think that a list of John Wayne's five best pictures has to include Fort Apache. It's the first and best of the cavalry trilogy that he did with John Ford. Oddly enough he has less screen time here than in the other two, due to the fact that he was co-starring with another big Hollywood name in Henry Fonda.It's first and foremost the story of a clash between two men who see the United States Army in very different terms. Fonda is a former general who's seen glory in the Civil War, but has been shunted aside. He wants to get back on top in the worst way. He's exiled to Fort Apache in the Arizona territory while the big headlines concerning the Indian wars are going to the campaign against the plains Indians which was true enough.Wayne has also seen some glory in the Civil War. But he's a professional soldier and just wants to live long enough to retire. In fact Ward Bond who is the sergeant major at the post has also dropped down in rank, he was a major in the Civil War and a Medal of Honor winner. This was a common occurrence at the end of the Civil War. During the war, promotions came swiftly because of battlefield service. Something called a brevet rank was instituted a kind of temporary promotion. You could be a brevet brigadier general and have an actual rank of something like major. After the Civil War as the U.S. Army shrunk to its pre-war size, soldier reverted to previous ranks. This was something John Ford was keenly aware of when he made Fort Apache.Ford's stock company was never better. Even minor bit parts are woven nicely into the whole story. And his photography of Monument Valley, it's beauty and vastness was never better even when he used color. Look at the scenes with John Agar and Shirley Temple riding and with Wayne and Pedro Armendariz on their way to parley with Cochise. Really great cinematography.Ford had a couple of inside comments in the film. In a scene where Henry Fonda is getting an incomplete message from the post telegrapher, the telegrapher who might have strolled in from a Cagney-O'Brien film informs his commander that the message was interrupted ""in the middle of the last woid."" With both Irish and southern recruits in Fort Apache, a Brooklynese telegrapher would not have been out of place.George O'Brien and Anna Lee, play Sam and Emily Collingwood who both knew Henry Fonda's Owen Thursday way back in the day. It's hinted that O'Brien had a drinking problem and that's why he's at Fort Apache, but he's looking for a transfer out. It comes as the regiment is moving out against Cochise. Charles Collingwood was the second in command to Admiral Nelson at Trafalgar. Nelson became a British hero martyr, historians know about Charles Collingwood. When newspapermen at the end of Fort Apache remark about men like ""Collingworth""not being remembered, it was John Ford making a statement about the worth of all the men who contribute their lives to defend their nations not just the leader heroes.That remark by the way is the stage for one of John Wayne's finest acted scenes in his career. A soliloquy photographed through a cabin window about the life of the professional soldier, the camaraderie, the toughness, the bravery required of these men and how they deliver for their nation. In a later film John Ford uses the line that in the west ""when the legend becomes fact, print the legend."" Henry Fonda's quest for martial glory was a blunder, but his story for the sake and tradition of his regiment is whitewashed and he becomes an inspiration.Of course some of the lowbrow comedy that one expects from John Ford is here aplenty with the four drinking sergeants and their efforts to make soldiers out of the recruits. Led by Victor McLaglen, the quartet rounds out with Dick Foran, Jack Pennick, and Pedro Armendariz. See how they dispose of the contraband they are charged with destroying and its consequences.Fort Apache also takes the side of the Indian here. Cochise played by an impassive Miguel Inclan is a figure of strength and dignity. Later on Jeff Chandler in another film brought speech to the dignity and that role launched his career. Cochise is the only true major figure in the film. He bedeviled the U.S. Cavalry for over a decade in Arizona Territory with guerrilla tactics Mao Tse Tung would have envied.Fort Apache is a grand ensemble film and you will not be bored for one second in watching it.",bkoganbing22,June/2005,10," ""They're The Regiment""",1,"[think, list, john, wayne, five, best, picture, include, fort, apache, first, best, cavalry, trilogy, john, ford, oddly, enough, less, screen, time, two, due, fact, another, big, hollywood, name, henry, first, foremost, story, clash, two, men, see, united, state, army, different, term, fonda, former, general, see, glory, civil, war, shunt, aside, want, get, back, top, bad, way, exile, fort, apache, arizona, territory, big, headline, concern, indian, war, go, campaign, plain, indian, true, also, see, glory, civil, war, professional, soldier, want, live, long, enough, retire, fact, ward, bond, sergeant, major, post, also, drop, rank, major, civil, war, medal, honor, winner, common, occurrence, ...]","[i, think, that, a list, of, john wayne, five best pictures, has, to, include, fort apache, it, is, first and best, of, the cavalry trilogy, that, he, did, with, john ford, oddly, enough, he, has, less screen time, here, than in, other, due, to, the fact, that, he, was, co-starring, with, another big hollywood name, in, henry fonda.it, is, first, foremost, the story, of, a clash, between, two men, see, the united states, army, in, very different terms, fonda, is, former general, is seen, glory, in, the civil war, has been shunted, aside, he, wants, to, get, back, on, top, in, the worst way, he, is exiled, to, fort, apache, in, the arizona territory, while, the big headlines, concerning, the indian wars, are going, to, the campaign, against, the plains indians, was, true, has also seen, some glory, in, the civil war, he, is, a professional soldier, just wants, to, live, long, ...]",264.13396374582766,9.73215173124844,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,1,2,1,4,2,3,1,0,1,2,0,5.9444444444444455,270,407,think list john waynes best pictures include fort apache first best cavalry trilogy john ford oddly enough less screen time due fact co starring another big hollywood name henry fonda first foremost story clash men united states army different terms fonda former general seen glory civil war shunted aside wants top worst way exiled fort apache arizona territory big headlines concerning indian wars going campaign plains indians true enough wayne seen glory civil war professional soldier wants live long enough retire fact ward bond sergeant major post dropped rank major civil war medal honor winner common occurrence end civil war war promotions came swiftly battlefield service something called brevet rank instituted kind temporary promotion could brevet brigadier general actual rank something like major civil war u army shrunk pre war size soldier reverted previous ranks something john ford keenly aware made fort apache fords stock company never better even minor bit parts woven nicely whole story photography monument valley beauty vastness never better even used color look scenes john agar shirley temple riding wayne pedro armendariz way parley cochise really great cinematography ford couple inside comments film scene henry fonda getting incomplete message post telegrapher telegrapher might strolled cagney obrien film informs commander message interrupted middle last woid irish southern recruits fort apache brooklynese telegrapher would place george obrien anna lee play sam emily collingwood knew henry fondas owen thursday way day hinted obrien drinking problem fort apache looking transfer comes regiment moving cochise charles collingwood second command admiral nelson trafalgar nelson became british hero martyr historians know charles collingwood newspapermen end fort apache remark men like collingworth remembered john ford making statement worth men contribute lives defend nations leader heroes remark way stage john waynes finest acted scenes career soliloquy photographed cabin window life professional soldier camaraderie toughness bravery required men deliver nation later film john ford uses line west legend becomes fact print legend henry fondas quest martial glory blunder story sake tradition regiment whitewashed becomes inspiration course lowbrow comedy expects john ford aplenty drinking sergeants efforts soldiers recruits led victor mclaglen quartet rounds dick foran jack pennick pedro armendariz dispose contraband charged destroying consequences fort apache takes side indian cochise played impassive miguel inclan figure strength dignity later jeff chandler another film brought speech dignity role launched career cochise true major figure film bedeviled u cavalry decade arizona territory guerrilla tactics mao tse tung would envied fort apache grand ensemble film bored second watching,0.027684742158426385,0.3691520467836258,1
Fort Apache (1948) - IMDb,"This is overrated John Wayne western. I like Wayne, and I like westerns but that doesn't mean I like all of his movies. There are just too many scenes that go on too long, such as watching men ride horses to and fro, or people in line in a dance session. Where's the editing? Also, the ending was very unsatisfying in which the ""mean"" officers is made out to be a hero in here, which wasn't the truth. The fact is he led his men into a needless slaughter. Shirley Temple's role (""Philadelphia Thursday"") was also disappointing. True, she look very pretty and was interesting to see as a 20-year-old, but her role was dour - which doesn't fit her image- and she and John Agar (""Lt. Michael Shannon O'Rourke"") want to get married after having known each other for just a couple of days???!! (Only in the movies, although Temple wound up marrying Agar in real life!).The best part of the film as the scenery, but I also say that in a John Ford-directed western because likes Monument Valley, and so do I. Ford seems to feature it in all his westerns, and it always looks good.

Fury (2014) - IMDb,"Reviewer after reviewer criticizes this movie for its phony depictions of the war, clichés and unrealistic battle scenes. There is only one significant fact that is crucial to know when it comes to the accuracy of the depiction; Shermans were going to be your coffin in a face-off with a Tiger. If you want serious historical detail then consider watching a WWII documentary. I think the overall depictions were secondary and only serve as the backdrop for the director's real message which was the painful slow process of the relationship that was built between these guys in a tragic situation. I think Ayers did a masterful job at this. You think Brad Pitt is a second rate actor? Watch his facial expressions during the scenes in the room with Logan Lerman and the 2 women; Watch his nervous breakdowns. Watch him in the ""Why are you such an asshole?"" scene. Watch him as he jokes with his guys about Hitler and chocolate bars. Even with Wardaddy's personal weaknesses, by the middle of the movie you understand why these guys liked, admired and respected him, and I'll bet you do also. His timing and delivery, in my opinion, are better than Tom Hanks on this best day. Watch LaBoeuf's nervous leg, and a list of other endearing nuanced details; He plays a very convincing religious proselytizer. During the tank battle if you didn't feel like your life was threatened then you were probably on xanex. I'm not sure that there is another film that conveys this kind of claustrophobic camaraderie from a tank crew's viewpoint.

Fury (2014) - IMDb,"OK, lets face it. We are over movies where one American kills 20 Germans who seemingly can't hit the wall of a Barn. They were big in the 1950's, and 1970s, but not any longer.Fury is a gritty film, with great productions values, really period vehicles, settings and costume. The acting is good, but it is let down by tow things.Clichéd characters. There is the tough commander, the new kid, the slightly crazy guy. There are a lot of clichéd characters here.Unrealistic battle scenes. Seriously I just switched off in the last scene. 20 or 30 SS guys with Panzerfasut would have destroyed an immobilied Sherman tank in 5 or 6 minutes.

Well, what makes the film shine so much? there are about several reasons.Ajay Devgan gives his very best performance here, as he did in 'Legend of Bhagat Singh'. Devgan manages to capture every emotion possible, by a man who is a policeman but also a human being, Gracy Singh does a decent work as well, despite having very brief appearance. Apart from Devgan's powerhouse performance, it's practically the whole cast that deserves to be applauded for doing justice to their various roles as well, above all Manoj Joshi and Yashpal Sharma deliver brilliant performances that just breathes even more life into the film. There is not a single cast actor who hasn't done any justice to his character, therefore 'Gangajal' is a small masterpiece and one of the rare gems of Bollywood drama. because of its honest team work by the whole cast and crew.

Gangster's Paradise: Jerusalema (2008) - IMDb,"I saw this in the Pan-African Images Sidebar at the 33rd Cleveland International Film Festival.It's an interesting mix of local South African dialect and English, with Rapulana Seiphemo extending his lead role from ""Tsotsi"" which is appropriate, since the story line is derivative of that film. This is about the adult Tsotsi could readily become: an ambitious gangster, a Sowetan Robin Hood whose crimes often mirror what the legal ethic endorses, but for the character Kunene it's more about his community.A couple of historical quotes figure large in this. Although Marx is attributed as the author of the ""all property is theft"" line in the movie, Marx considered this statement by Proudhon as ""self-refuting"". But it does seem an apt theme to the story of a culture in flux after its colonial disenfranchisement. Al Capone's ""the bigger the crime the bigger the payoff"" summarizes the operational ethic quite well.A somewhat raw film (which is why I gave it a 5 I grade ""bell-curve"") this is still an interesting movie from a developing South African market.

Get Carter (2000) - IMDb,"A mob enforcer goes back to his native Seattle to sort out the suspicious death of his brother.The original film is one of the best English thrillers of all time and despite being made nearly thirty years  ago still packs a punch. Sadly this film is not really in its league, despite a bigger budget and more ground coverage. The main problem is that the authors clearly love the original and this leaves so much of what happens as a question mark to the new viewer. Characters are thrown in from nowhere and Carters involvement with his bosses' girl is almost in another movie. Micheal Caine's small role (as a barman) is funny in that he was the original Jack Carter, here reprised by Sly Stallone.While quick to admit this is mediocre stuff you have to say that you get your share of car chases (well done too), fights, creeps, sleaze, family bonding, shoot outs and even the odd bit of light humour. The fight between Stallone and Mickey Rouke (here playing a buisnessman-stroke-creep) for example.This film features interesting cinematography, with strange forward jump cuts (ripped off from The Limey), odd angles and the use of colour filters. In short, the producers trying to make more out of the material than is in the script. The choice of a wet Seattle is also curious and different. Presumably the nearest to Newcastle-Upon-Tyne (the setting of the original) that the producers could think of. So it is only an average product, but will see much worse than this in our lifetime and it does move along at a fair and steady clip. People are getting to knock Stallone for being Stallone, but he doesn't do bad a job here, a stonefaced enforcer that is prepared to shed a tear when needs be! Not great acting, but he looks the part.Don't be put off by the low IMDB ratings, plenty of worthy films are two or three points higher but are far more boring. Popcorn fodder it may be, but I thought it was worth seeing through and even declared myself modestly entertained at the end of it. Not as good as the original but not a lot is.Footnote: This is actually not the first remake of Get Carter.

Get Carter (2000) - IMDb,"A remake of the 1971 film with Michael Caine.Las Vegas mob enforcer Jack Carter travels to Seattle to investigate his brother's mysterious death. Local crime lords want him out, but Carter unrelentingly proceeds in finding the truth.Starting with a promising beginning (though it remains amusing that someone thought that Stallone can match Caine's acting) the film soon slumps into a bad case of mediocrity. It has the same idea as the original and tries to be as badass with its kinetic and almost experimental direction, but ends up being just poor. Stallone's Carter is given an almost soft side that goes complete against the character from the first film. On top of that there are some enjoyable car chases, but they serve as sensationalism that was critically lacking from the first film.Then there is the ending, which has some merit (since the film already establish Carter as softer then the original), but even so, it is still pretty stupid and leaves the film with little to say or resonate with.

Getaway (2013) - IMDb,"I don't normally take the time to write reviews as I don't feel I have much to add to everyone else's take. But Getaway has been so poorly received, unjustifiably so in my opinion, that I thought I'd weigh in.This is a popcorn movie. Nothing more. I understood that going in. It's not high art. It doesn't revolutionize movie-making, and is not even the high point of the genre. But it's entertaining, and that's all I ask of a movie. Give me some popcorn and a Coke, and dim the lights, let me forget about the world for a couple hours, and I'm happy.The two leads are very good in my opinion. Ethan Hawke is a very capable actor, and he brought a depth to his character that I didn't expect. He expressed concern without being overly dramatic or gnashing his teeth or chewing up the scenery, and conveyed his character's limitations without appearing dumb. Selena Gomez was bright, and had the expected attitude of someone her character's age without being precocious or annoying.Most of the plot was admittedly easy to figure out early on, but the movie still provided plenty of excitement in how it got there. There were some aspects of the story that were dismissed without explaining a lot of detail, but it didn't rely on otherwise smart people doing dumb things to make it all work, and I appreciated that as well.I've read criticisms by others concerning the ""shaky-cam"" technique during the chase scenes. I didn't find that to be a problem in the least. It was much less annoying or even apparent than in movies like Transformers. I found everything was easy to follow and served the story well - I didn't think any style choices got in the way. And there was one street-level point of view sequence that I thought was especially well done - presumably a single take - that gave me a real rush.Overall, I enjoyed Getaway, but that may be in part because I went in with low expectations due to its opening weekend box office and some negative reviews. With stiff competition this summer there are certainly better choices for your entertainment dollar. I don't know if I'd even consider this in the top ten or twenty films this year.

Getaway (2013) - IMDb,"A late night car chase through the cosmopolitan streets of Sofia, Bulgaria; throbbing with that distinct and exotic coolness European cities exude when darkness falls... it's an idea that could have been executed very well. Unfortunately not in the case of Getaway, which instead slaughters the idea so poorly you can't help but feel sorry for it. Everyone loves a good car chase. You won't find one in Getaway though. All the chase scenes are nothing more than a nauseating rapid succession of very brief cuts. It's literally   impossible to get a wider picture and understanding of what is going. Many scenes could have been quite impressive if they had just been shot at a wider angle and held a longer frame. This does not happen once though. The breakneck speed at which the cuts are made (close up of car headlights-exploding box-back wheel-driver-back to headlights) just doesn't allow the chase to flow and is frustrating to watch. How can one appreciate what's happening when they can't even see what's happening?Selena Gomez may be trying to break out of her Disney image (and good for her) but that doesn't mean she's suited to every role. Her performance here feels weak and definitely isn't helped by an even weaker dialogue. Ethan Hawke's performance is more believable, but it's only one taste bud of sweetness in the overall bad taste this movie leaves. There's pretty much zero laughs, the first half is filled with the characters bickering annoyingly, the chase scenes are visually unwatchable, it's painfully unnecessarily noisy and the plot is nothing but mediocre. Fortunately I viewed the film at an advance screening and therefore given it was free I just felt disappointed, rather than feeling ripped off as I would have had I actually handed over my hard earned dollars in exchange for that mess. I tried my best to enjoy the film, but to be honest all I wanted to do was getaway.  ",ryan_aus0427,August/2013,1," Nothing but a nauseating, noisy mess",0,"[late, night, car, chase, cosmopolitan, street, sofia, bulgaria, throb, distinct, exotic, coolness, european, city, exude, darkness, fall, idea, could, execute, well, unfortunately, case, getaway, instead, slaughter, idea, poorly, help, feel, sorry, everyone, love, good, car, chase, find, one, getaway, though, chase, scene, nothing, nauseate, rapid, succession, brief, cut, literally, impossible, get, wider, picture, understand, go, many, scene, could, quite, impressive, shot, wider, angle, held, longer, frame, happen, though, breakneck, speed, cut, make, close, car, headlight, allow, chase, flow, frustrate, watch, one, appreciate, happen, even, see, happen, selena, gomez, may, try, break, disney, image, good, mean, suit, every, role, performance, feel, ...]","[a late night car chase, through, the cosmopolitan streets, of, sofia, bulgaria, throbbing, with that, distinct and, exotic coolness european cities, exude, when, darkness, falls, it, is, an idea, could have been executed, very well, unfortunately not, in, the case, of, getaway, instead slaughters, the idea, so, poorly, you, cannot help, feel, sorry, for, it. everyone, loves, a good car chase, you, will not find, in, getaway, though, all the chase scenes, are, nothing, more, than, nauseating, rapid succession, of, very brief cuts, it, is, literally  , impossible, to, get, a wider picture, understanding, of, is going, many scenes, could have been, quite impressive, if, they, had just been, shot, at, a wider angle, held, a longer frame, does not happen, once though, the breakneck speed, at, which the cuts, are made, close, up of, car, headlights-exploding box-back wheel-driver-back, to, headlights, just does not allow, the chase, to, flow, is, frustrating, to, watch, how, can, appreciate, is happening, when, they, cannot even see, is happening?selena, gomez, ...]",-11.265369479168553,-10.472280741437153,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,6.0510948905109485,137,165,late night car chase cosmopolitan streets sofia bulgaria throbbing distinct exotic coolness european cities exude darkness falls idea could executed well unfortunately case getaway instead slaughters idea poorly help feel sorry everyone loves good car chase getaway though chase scenes nothing nauseating rapid succession brief cuts literally impossible wider picture understanding going many scenes could quite impressive shot wider angle held longer frame happen though breakneck speed cuts made close car headlights exploding box wheel driver headlights allow chase flow frustrating watch appreciate happening even happening selena gomez may trying break disney image good mean suited every role performance feels weak definitely helped even weaker dialogue ethan hawkes performance believable taste bud sweetness overall bad taste movie leaves pretty much laughs first half filled characters bickering annoyingly chase scenes visually unwatchable painfully unnecessarily noisy plot nothing mediocre fortunately viewed film advance screening therefore given free felt disappointed rather feeling ripped would actually handed hard earned dollars exchange mess tried best enjoy film honest wanted getaway,0.022115384615384617,0.581517094017094,1

Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2011) - IMDb,"Okay, I'm a Nic Cage fanboy. Let's get that out of the way. I'll watch anything the guy does no matter how terrible the reviews are, and sometimes I'll be pleasantly surprised, as was the case with ""Seeking Justice"", ""Drive Angry"", and ""Kiss of Death"". The guy has some hidden gems in his career. Is Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance one of them? Hell no.The first Ghost Rider was campy and stupid, but it was a watchable popcorn action movie and it had Eva Mendes (hence, watchable). Spirit of Vengeance is just stupid. Everything about it is stupid. No part of this movie is fleshed out and none of it is interesting. It throws you right into the action with no exposition. It's just a bunch of things happening on screen oozing with CGI to make up for the complete lack of substance. You can tell this is the same guy that directed Crank: the difference is that movie didn't need any substance because the premise was so fun. This movie just pisses on Ghost Rider's origin (literally) and expects you to enjoy watching sh*t blow up for the sake of sh*t blowing up. The writing in this movie is especially horrendous; did they hire a 10 year old to do the screenplay? It sure as hell seems like it.So you may be asking yourself, ""why give it a 4/10 if it's so awful?"" Well, I'm a sucker for laughably bad movies and this definitely qualifies. I mean, the dialogue alone tries to take itself seriously but ends up providing really good unintentional laughs. But I'll be fair, not all of this movie sucks.Nicolas Cage is always enjoyable to watch. You can tell he's invested in the role, and his dedication really holds this movie together. Idris Elba is also in this movie for some reason and he's great in anything, even if his character is completely throwaway. The other acting is serviceable I guess. You can't really blame any actors here because it's obvious the filmmakers wanted it to be a massive CGI-fest with stupid dialogue to lead action sequence A to action sequence B. To their credit, the CGI in this movie is pretty cool. Ghost Rider looks badass, the visuals in the big set pieces are nice to look at, and if you have no interest in the story you can definitely shut your brain off and enjoy the insanity happening on screen. So in a nutshell, you don't need to see this movie. You really don't. Not even the great Nicolas Cage is enough to hold this piece of trash together. But if you're really stoned or just want to see cool sh*t on screen for an hour and a half and there's literally nothing else to watch, go ahead and knock yourself out with Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.

Ghost in the Shell (1995) - IMDb,"Ghost in the Shell is a visually stunning animated masterpiece. Japanese animation has always been in a class of its own, so I won't even attempt to describe the incredible attention to detail and beautiful imagery in this movie. In this case the animation is merely icing for what is one of the most important works of science fiction in recent years.Every generation has had books and movies that have contributed to our collective understanding of reality. Prior to World War II this included books like Yevgeny Zamyatin's ""We"" and Huxley's ""Brave New World"", and later Orwell's ""1984"". Today most warnings about the future fall into the category of science fiction. Science fiction began to fill this role when Arthur C. Clarke's ""2001"" warned us of the potential for humanity to create intelligent, even sentient computers that could murder their human creators. ""2001"" envisioned computer intelligence imprisoned in the physical body of a computer. Where ""2001"" left off, Ghost in the Shell begins.Ghost in the Shell tells the story of a future in which a computer program, Project 2501, becomes self-aware and begins a quest to fill basic needs it feels are qualifiers of being alive by controlling computers and people to achieve its ultimate goals. Whereas the HAL-9000 computer was relatively harmless, owing to its confinement in the Odyssey space ship, Project 2501 is a recognition that the global internet could have dire consequences for all of us. By comparison, this new villain is virtually invincible. But is Project 2501 a villain?Most people who have told me that they didn't like this move said that they didn't understand it. Indeed, the story and concepts are very complicated. I have watched it several times and still get new things out of it every time. Roger Ebert called Ghost in the Shell, ""Unusually intelligent and challenging science fiction, aimed at smart audiences"".Ghost in the Shell is full of fascinating dialog, such as this diatribe about the cycle of life and death by Project 2501. ""A copy is just an identical image. There is the possibility that a single virus could destroy an entire set of systems, and copies do not give rise to variety and originality. Life perpetuates itself through diversity, and this includes the ability to sacrifice itself when necessary. Cells repeat the process of degeneration and regeneration until one day they die, obliterating an entire set of memory and information. Only genes remain. Why continually repeat this cycle? Simply to survive by avoiding the weaknesses of an unchanging system.""Thus Ghost in the Shell goes beyond simply a prediction or warning for the future: it attempts to contribute to our understanding of reality by breaking existence down into biological terms and making us question, along with the characters in the movie, whether or not any of us has a soul. The characters in Ghost in the Shell are unusually deep and are a refreshing change from the one-dimensional stereotypes we've become numbed by in modern media. Ghost in the Shell would be required reading in many high school and university courses if it weren't for the fortuitous fact that it can be enjoyed in this beautifully animated feature film.

They say its ""about"" conscious, identity, and our dim future...but why should we care?For me, a film must have strong characters to anchor you to the story. They must be realistic and relateable, so you can understand and emphasize with their experiences. But to call GitS's characters two-dimensional is stretching the definition. The story is so focused on the case, we rarely spend any time with the cast, and thus I couldn't care about their interactions or fate. The main character is especially uninteresting: when she supposedly undergoes a great change at the end of the film, she's just as wooden as before.The sacrifice of character isn't even worth the sci-fi, cyber mystery thrills. The plot is so bloated with techno-babel its almost incomprehensible. This isn't depth that requires multiple viewings to understand - this is just bad writing. With little emotion attached to the scenes, I barely maintained attention. Only a few action scenes are scattered through the film, and none are worth the wait.I will concede the animation is pretty good, especially the backgrounds. They're cartoons, but dark, detailed, and realistic. You get a decent sense of this advanced, yet dismal world. If only this quality were in a better film! Its easy to deride those against this film as people who ""just don't get it"". I'd say there's nothing important to take away. Its world is barely explored outside of the premise, and the lone conflict between the main character and villain is so bizarre it has no bearing to reality. Imagination and presentation does not equal depth. Ghost in the Shell felt like it needed another 30 minutes to explain things and develop its themes and characters. Its easily one of the worst films I have watched in terms of writing, but at least it looks good, and is a short burn. With the large amount of sci-fi we have access to these days, I wouldn't recommend GitS to anyone.",DonaldDooD20,July/2014,3, Interesting Themes Mean Nothing Without Proper Execution,0,"[ghost, seems, lucky, blade, runner, akira, blindsiding, audience, novelty, false, sense, depth, one, film, people, love, talk, little, say, portrays, theme, say, conscious, identity, dim, future, care, film, must, strong, character, anchor, story, must, realistic, relateable, understand, emphasize, experience, call, git, character, stretch, definition, story, focus, case, rarely, spend, time, cast, thus, could, care, interaction, fate, main, character, especially, uninteresting, supposedly, undergoes, great, change, end, film, wooden, sacrifice, character, even, worth, cyber, mystery, thrill, plot, bloat, almost, incomprehensible, depth, requires, multiple, viewing, understand, bad, write, little, emotion, attach, scene, barely, maintain, attention, action, scene, scatter, film, none, worth, concede, animation, ...]","[ghost, in, the she, will seems, to, be, as lucky, as, blade runner and akira, blindsiding, its audience, with, novelty and a false sense, of, depth, its, of, those films, where, people, love, to, talk, its, about, have, little, to, say, on, how, it, portrays, its themes, they, say, its, about, conscious, identity, our, dim future...but, why, should, we, care?for, me, a film, must have, strong characters, to, anchor, you, to, the story, they, must be, realistic and relateable, so, you, can understand, emphasize, with, their experiences, to, call, gits, characters two-dimensional, is stretching, the definition, the story, is so focused, on, the case, we, rarely spend, any time, with, the cast, thus i, could, not, care, about, their interactions or fate, the main character, is, especially uninteresting, when, she, supposedly undergoes, a great change, at, the end, of, the film, she, is, just as wooden, as, ...]",5.966507023337593,-7.633244202298673,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,6.173611111111112,144,181,ghost shell seems lucky blade runner akira blindsiding audience novelty false sense depth films people love talk little portrays themes conscious identity dim future care film must strong characters anchor story must realistic relateable understand emphasize experiences call gitss characters dimensional stretching definition story focused case rarely spend time cast thus could care interactions fate main character especially uninteresting supposedly undergoes great change end film wooden sacrifice character even worth sci fi cyber mystery thrills plot bloated techno babel almost incomprehensible depth requires multiple viewings understand bad writing little emotion attached scenes barely maintained attention action scenes scattered film none worth wait concede animation pretty good especially backgrounds cartoons dark detailed realistic decent sense advanced yet dismal world quality better film easy deride film people would nothing important take away world barely explored outside premise lone conflict main character villain bizarre bearing reality imagination presentation equal depth ghost shell felt like needed another 30 minutes explain things develop themes characters easily worst films watched terms writing least looks good short burn large amount sci fi access days would recommend gits anyone,0.13506235827664403,0.5004818594104309,1
Ghost in the Shell 2.0 (2008) - IMDb,"The new scenes are nicely executed for the most part, but completely unnecessary. As eye-candy on their own, they're not particularly impressive either. Further, they tend to break the flow of the film, especially when cutting directly from the new CG to the cel-animated original. Clearly, the entire film should have been revisited rather than this selective and perfunctory approach to an update. It reeks of something George Lucas would do (i say that negatively) and sadly, GITS2.0 fails to live up to his much more seamless updates of the original STAR WARS films.More importantly, some shots lose their original intent somewhat, for example the scene where Motoko rises to the surface during her dive; also the angel-vision that Motoko has just prior to being blasted by snipers was diluted. There are little details added here and there like rain etc, which do add to the atmosphere, but ultimately i was left wondering about the intentions of the people that carried out this re-envisioning. I cannot for a moment believe that Oshii was consulted regarding small but important decisions like changing the sex of the Puppet Master from male to female. In the absence of the original director's blessing, i have no choice but to condemn what seems to be a superficial attempt at re-marketing a classic.As an introduction to the franchise, GITS2.0 is still more than adequate, but it merely offers a diminished and disjointed experience compared to watching the original.The sound FX are improved, although lacking in subtlety.

Ghostbusters (1984) - IMDb,"This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CGI.Ghostbusters (1984) is the best classic original spectacular supernatural masterpiece from Ivan Reitman! One of if not the greatest films ever! My favorite film of all time! ""Ghostbusters"" is the film that made me become a fan ever since I was young! It had an awesome cast, cool special effects, hilarious dialogue and a kick-ass soundtrack! The film that can be watched over and over again! I grew up watching Ghostbusters on TV and the animated TV series The Real Ghostbusters (1986 - 1991). Ghostbusters II (1989) actually introduced me in to Ghostbusters. I loved them so much that I even said to my mom, when I grown up I will be a Ghostbuster! It was my fantasy. Watching it yesterday and I still love it. I love this flick to death! I still can't believe it how the world changed and how in the 80's the world was better than today! I always have enjoyed the sequel much better than as a child, it was my first movie but now as an adult, I love and enjoy the original movie to death! It is the only movie I own on Blu-ray disc and I still love it. This is an amazing movie! Funny, smart, well written and directed. It features an outstanding performance from Bill Murray, great showings by Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis and one of the last documented instances of Dan Aykroyd being funny on film (he was blown by a ghost!). In fact, the film gets a great performances from nearly everyone who appears in it- from Annie Potts, to the guy who played Lenny the Mayor, to the handsome cab driver who calls Rick Moranis an asshole. In addition, they had one of the best ""a-hole"" guys ever to appear on film, as the film's bad guy- I'm talking of course of the grossly under-rated William Atherton- who played the EPA guy, ""Dickless"". Atherton, of course went on to play memorable a-holes in Real Genius and of course he was the annoying reporter in Die Hard (1988) but here in Ghostbusters, you really see a solid performance by maybe the best guy to play an a-hole in films in the 80's. Next Year the reboot is coming out as Paul Feig's Ghostsnuters, Ghostbitches or Ghostflufers./: Ghostbusters (2016) with women now as a Ghostbusters! Why rebooting this awesome supernatural spectacular comedy flick? I know the sequel failed and Bill Murray did not want anything to do with it. But that doesn't mean that they shouldn't have made Ghostbusters III in the 90's, they should have! Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis tried so hard to convince Bill Murray to do it for the third sequel and they couldn't convinced him. They are going to ruin the Original movie! I don't want to see Ghostbusters with a female leads. Come on? The girls are not the Ghostbusters, they are three man a scientists and a one civilian. The Ghostbusters are the only one Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Bill Murray. They were always be the Ghostbusters that will be the case. No one else will be! No one else will replace them! This is like A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) that come out the same year as the Ghostbusters did, they remake it and that remake failed!! It was awful boring! Why remaking or rebooting my classic horror comedy's that I Love?! Ghostbusters (1984) are unique, classic 80's masterpiece! These were the best times for movies ever!!! One of my favorite soundtracks and movie of all time!They just don't make them like this anymore. This is comedic writing and performance at its peak... with quotes that everyone knows and enjoys. From ""This reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head"" to ""Symmetrical book stacking. Just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947"" to ""Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you! "" this is a CLASSIC movie! Ghostbusters is a true classic comedy that stands the test of time. The film is funny, awesome and entertaining. It has a lot of laughs. I love the soundtrack Ghostbusters Written and Performed by Ray Parker Jr. I think he did made a great soundtrack in the 80's. If there's something strange in your neighborhood, who you gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!!!! A film that can be watched with the various youngest to the very oldest of the family. Wonderful collection of characters. A film that is treasured by just about everyone that watches it. I miss movies from the 80's and this film felt so realistic. Sigourney Weaver was just so outstanding as Dana Barrett after she made the horror flick Alien (1979 and Aliens (1986).

Ghostbusters (1984) - IMDb,"When three parapsychology professors are fired from their university they decide to set up shop as paranormal investigators or ""Ghostbusters"". Their first client is Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) who approaches the Ghostbusters after witnessing strange visions and hearing the name ""Zool"" when she opened her fridge. Dr Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) checks out her apartment but finds no evidence of paranormal activity. However, when Dana starts exhibiting strange behaviour, the professors investigate further and discover that the apartment complex that she lives in is a gateway for the occult. With paranormal activity now reaching epidemic proportions The Ghostbusters must now try to save the city against seemingly impossible odds.I, like many, have fond memories of Ghostbusters as a child and hoped that I would have the same feeling again when watching it as an adult. Unfortunately, I only found moments of this film to be enjoyable rather than finding it enjoyable as a whole.The beginning of the film is memorable and the 3 professors all seem to be setup as very different characters which generally produces an interesting camaraderie between Aykroyd, Murray and Ramis. The first 20 minutes or so are a lot of fun from Venkman's fraudulent shenanigans to The Ghostbusters chasing Slimer round the hotel. It's explosive and fast-paced, but after these scenes it seems to fall apart slightly and the middle portion of the film bogs down too much with uninteresting and unnecessary scenes (Venkman's creepy stalking of Dana being one example). Rick Moranis' turn as Dana's nerdy neighbour Louis Tully also wasn't particularly funny and was more annoying than anything else. A large portion of their story arc sees them as Gatekeeper and Keymaster in the occult world which was an aspect of the story that wasn't that involving and also one that never really had a particularly satisfying pay-off.In fact watching this again as an adult I noticed both the plot and the story are extremely thin; there certainly isn't enough of either element to warrant its 2 hour running time. Considering the title is ""Ghostbusters"" it would have been nice to see more examples of ""Ghostbusting"" which sadly only seems to feature heavily towards the end. There's also no ignoring how silly the film is for most of its running time, but sadly for me a lot of it was silly in an eye-rolling way rather than being silly in a funny way.Ultimately with Ghostbusters you're left with a film that has impressive beginning and an impressive ending, but one that has an unsatisfying middle-section which always felt uncertain and at odds with the rest of the film. Older teens (who are prepared to overlook the rather thin plot) may still find this to be quite enjoyable, but as for me I only found some parts of it to be enjoyable and feel that I may have just outgrown it.",jimbo-53-18651128,May/2016,5, Loved this as a child but wasn't quite as impressed watching it again as an adult,0,"[three, parapsychology, professor, fire, university, decide, set, shop, paranormal, investigator, ghostbusters, first, client, dana, barrett, sigourney, weaver, approach, ghostbusters, witness, strange, vision, hearing, name, zool, open, fridge, dr, peter, venkman, bill, murray, check, apartment, find, evidence, paranormal, activity, however, dana, start, exhibit, strange, behaviour, professor, investigate, discover, apartment, complex, life, gateway, occult, paranormal, activity, reach, epidemic, proportion, ghostbusters, must, try, save, city, seemingly, impossible, like, many, fond, memory, ghostbusters, child, hop, would, feel, watch, adult, unfortunately, found, moment, film, enjoyable, rather, find, enjoyable, begin, film, memorable, professor, seem, setup, different, character, generally, produce, interest, camaraderie, aykroyd, murray, ramis, first, minute, ...]","[when, three parapsychology professors, are fired, from, their university they, decide, to, set, up, shop, as, paranormal investigators, ghostbusters, their first client, is dana, barrett, sigourney weaver, approaches, the ghostbusters, after, witnessing, strange visions, hearing, the name, zool, when, she, opened, her fridge, dr peter venkman, bill murray, checks, out, her apartment, finds, no evidence, of, paranormal activity, however, when, dana, starts exhibiting, strange behaviour, the professors, investigate, further, discover, that, the apartment, complex, that, she, lives, is, a gateway, for, the occult, with, paranormal activity, now reaching, epidemic, proportions, the ghostbusters, must now try, to, save, the city, against, seemingly impossible odds.i, like, many, have, fond memories, of, ghostbusters, as, a child, hoped, that, i, would have, the same feeling, again when, watching, it, as, an adult, unfortunately, i, only found, moments, of, this film, to, be, enjoyable, rather, than, finding, it, ...]",78.36640096832305,-7.132763960106256,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,3,1,4,0,5,5,4,6.1530054644808745,183,242,parapsychology professors fired university decide set shop paranormal investigators ghostbusters first client dana barrett sigourney weaver approaches ghostbusters witnessing strange visions hearing name zool opened fridge dr peter venkman bill murray checks apartment finds evidence paranormal activity however dana starts exhibiting strange behaviour professors investigate discover apartment complex lives gateway occult paranormal activity reaching epidemic proportions ghostbusters must save city seemingly impossible odds like many fond memories ghostbusters child hoped would feeling watching adult unfortunately found moments film enjoyable rather finding enjoyable whole beginning film memorable 3 professors seem setup different characters generally produces interesting camaraderie aykroyd murray ramis first 20 minutes lot fun venkmans fraudulent shenanigans ghostbusters chasing slimer round hotel explosive fast paced scenes seems fall apart slightly middle portion film bogs much uninteresting unnecessary scenes venkmans creepy stalking dana example rick moranis turn danas nerdy neighbour louis tully particularly funny annoying anything else large portion story arc sees gatekeeper keymaster occult world aspect story involving never really particularly satisfying pay fact watching adult noticed plot story extremely thin certainly enough either element warrant 2 hour running time considering title ghostbusters would nice examples ghostbusting sadly seems feature heavily towards end ignoring silly film running time sadly lot silly eye rolling way rather silly funny way ultimately ghostbusters left film impressive beginning impressive ending unsatisfying middle section always felt uncertain odds rest film older teens prepared overlook rather thin plot may still quite enjoyable found parts enjoyable feel may outgrown,0.03009118541033435,0.6202887537993922,1
Ghosts of Mars (2001) - IMDb,"Firstly, if I see another review labelling Ghosts of Mars, Vampires or Escape from L.A 'Carpenter attempting to have another hit movie' my head will explode like Snake Plissken's would have done. Hello people: CARPENTER HAS NEVER HAD A HIT MOVIE! Besides maybe Halloween, Starman, Christine and Escape from New York to a lesser extent, Carpenter has made bomb after bomb. Certainly the films that have the biggest following today; The Thing, Big Trouble in Little China, They Live, they all were torn apart on release. So, surprise surprise everyone hates Ghost of Mars like they did The Thing. Now, I am in no way comparing Ghosts to The Thing, which is an vastly superior film. But Ghosts is in the same position; as it will be in fifteen years time when people will look back on it and say 'Maybe it wasn't that bad.' WHICH IT ISN'T. What elements in this film aren't Carpenter? The western atmosphere? The focus on action and story, and not character? Vast hoards of nameless enemies? These were all in Assault on Precinct 13. Oh wait, no one liked that in 1976 because they were so brain dead they had to wait for a cult following to develop before they gave it a second chance. So it must be the structure. Is the structure, with it's flashbacks-within-flashbacks and weird editing any more bizarre than the corkscrew science behind 'Prince of Darkness'? Oh that's right, everyone hated that in 1987. So I'm looking for the faults. That's it, the action isn't very good. Oh damn, it wasn't very good in 'Big Trouble in Little China' either. Wait, didn't it take people fifteen years to 'get' that film as well? Maybe it's the fact that it has Ice Cube in the lead. Yeah, Carpenter defiantly shouldn't have let a non-actor take the leadoh wait, Roddy Piper! If 'They Live' was made in 2001 that would be bashed for having an non-actor carrying it, but for some reason because it was made in 1988 (blasted on release) Roddy Piper's performance is the stuff of cult legend.All said and complained about, if Ghosts of Mars was released in 1987 or something it wouldn't be getting bashed now. Hell, Jason Statham might have been the new Kurt Russell. There's plenty of fun to be had here, and Carpenter certainly hasn't 'lost his vision' as a lot of the so-called fans who are stuck somewhere around 1982 claim. If anything, with Ghosts of Mars and it's OTT structure, Carpenter is developing on it.Maybe it's just me, but I can't understand how someone can hate Ghost of Mars and have unconditional love for Assault on Precinct 13. Give Ghosts another go, and watch it with an open mind.

Ghosts of Mars (2001) - IMDb,"*** MUST READ BEFORE PAYING REAL MONEY *** John Carpenter was once a really good filmmaker, well at least a good director. Just think of the 1982 classic ""The Thing"", which is simply excellent. He didn't write that movie, but the cinematography is very good. Unfortunately he DID write ""John Carpenter's Vampires"" a few years back, and it sucked. It sucked bad. He also wrote ""Ghosts of Mars"" (referred to as GOM from now on), which sucks even more. I'm a fan of horror, sci-fi, monster movies and dramas.This movie is none of the above, but it tries to be a horror movie against a sci-fi setting. It's quite tragic because all it becomes is a lame monster movie on Mars. Or wait... this movie is actually just a western in space...with monsters.SO WHAT'S BAD ABOUT IT? Well, lots of things. To begin with the movie is set in the year 2176 or something. About 170 years from now. One of the first things one notices is the fashion of 2176. Remember ""Star Trek"" the original series with Kirk? Everything looked like a space-up:ed 1970s, right? Same here, but late 90s. What about technology then? Embaressing. Almost nothing has improved. Many things are ridiculous to be set 170 years from now. Sure, it's the early colonisation of Mars and tech isn't really high in the colonies. But some of the things you'll see are just silly.What about guns? There are alot of guns in the movie, seing how it's a western and all. Well for starters how do Berettas and SPAS-12s sound? No? Don't have a place in 2176? That's right, they won't have a role at all, they'll be 200 year old antiquities. There's also an automatic rifle, which I've forgotten the name of. I think it's a FN model, about 10 years old. What is it doing there? Oh well, in the absolute ending sequence a pair ofSMGs appear that are unidentifiable, as they're tailor-made for the movie (finally). But I must say they're some of the shiniest guns I've ever seen. The design is bad, I'll accept that. But why are they so shiny? Ridiculous.***WARNING ""SPOILER"" BELOW***The opening scene of GOM is a really bad attempt at copying the Ripley investigations scenes from the all-time brilliant movie ""Aliens"". Natasha is being questioned about the recent events on Mars, where she starts recanting the movie. So after about 4 minutes into the movie, we already know that she's the only survivor. Great...nice spoiler. So the whole ""who's gonna make it"" is off, now what? That is often the only thing movies like GOM and ""Pitch Black"" have going for them, But GOM gives it away in the opening sequence. Very poor.What also bothers me are flashback scenes that aren't called for. When a person starts to explain something, we are taken back to a scene we've seen and are shown it again, just to know what the conversation refers to. It seems John Carpenter must've known we'd be sleeping ourselves through this movie.Again the western style is apparent, the law enforcers (read Sheriff and his deputies) have shotguns and the sheriff has a long coat typical of western movies. There's an old style iron bar jail, the railroad (Mars express or whatever) and a bunch of outlaws (the ghosts).So what about the bad guys in the movie? I almost s**t a brick when I saw them. They suck bad. They are simple miners than have been possessed by the ghosts and suddenly start piercing and painting and sickly decorating themselves. It's explained as something the ghosts used to do when they were alive....*sigh*....Oh well, they have this leader guy and he looks like a devil or something, in the gothiest outfit I've ever seen in a sci-fi. It's leather, it's black, it has rings and stuff, bla, bla. The funniest part is when this guy issues commands or preaches to his flock. It's like he only can say one word and that word is something like ""waah"" or perhaps ""raah"". And he wants to say these complicated sentences of about 8-14 words each. But all that comes out is ""waah, waah, raah, raah, waah, waah, raah, waaaaaah"". I almost swallowed my icecream scoop when I first heard him, then I just laughed myself into a coma. And he's REALLY p***ed all through the movie. He's supposed to be mad because invaders (the humans) have set foot on his planet. But I'd say his rage is so immense that he's got a personal issue of some kind. He's just sooo mad. Maybe it's because he can't say any other words than ""waah"" and ""raah"". I know that would p**s me off.The religious manner in which his subordinates worship him, with this whole ""primitive caveman meets Jehova's witness bent on Nazi occultism"" style is pathetic.THE ACTORS Natasha Henstridge (ze girrrl from Schpecies) can do better, she's no actress, nor a model, but even she can do better. Ice Cube actually isn't all that bad, he proved that in ""Boyz 'n' the Hood"" among other films, this must be the worst performance from him that I've ever seen, much due to the script.This movie so badly wants to be a good SCI-FI, but it can't be that, because it so badly wants to be a good WESTERN, but it can't be that, because it so badly wants to be a good MONSTER MOVIE, but it can't because the script and props suck.OK, what about budget? Well ""John Carpenter"" is a name that should allow for some money to pour in. Hm...but not if the sponsors saw ""John Carpenter's Vampires"". I believe most of the money went into making the train that traffics Mars. The design is bad, humans would never build anything like that train. It looks OK though, in being actually there I mean. It's OK...nothing more. Explosions are plentiful (the ghosts have dynamite) and bad. Everyone's on a springboard and fly in a predictable trajectory in order to not hurt themselves. Typical ""A-Team"" action complete with tons of clichés and lame Wesley Snipes-like comments.Do I sound a tad irritated? That is because I payed good money to view this movie. I feel people have the right to know what to expect as I have the right to be upset about what I saw. This review contains no profanity so there should be no reason to not post it.Overall : I gave it a 1 in my vote.

Gladiator (2000) - IMDb,"Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world.

Godsend (2004) - IMDb,"After losing their son, Adam (Cameron Bright), to a freak accident, Paul (Greg Kinnear) and Jessie Duncan (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), are approached by Dr. Richard Wells (Robert De Niro), with a risky and illegal idea--to try ""replacing"" Adam with a clone.In my way of looking at ratings, 7s are Cs. They tend to do as many things wrong as right. Godsend has some admirable script characteristics, a good to great cast and some very good technical aspects. But it also has negative script characteristics and some questionable directing and editing.Overall, I believe Godsend is worth watching, so let's look at the positive points first. It's rare that filmic science fiction--and this is just as much as science fiction film as a thriller or horror film--tries to tackle ""hard science"" as exposition and motivation. Although Godsend also mixes some strong fantasy elements into its ""twist"" and the consequences that lead to the film being a thriller/horror picture, the basic idea is one rooted in actual genetics. De Niro is given quite a few mouthfuls of science-oriented dialogue that are fairly sound, and for my money, he delivers them well.I'm a big fan of De Niro's, so I tend to be gracious in my evaluation of his work. But I could see where some viewers less enamored with De Niro overall might find his performance here questionable. It's certainly a bit different than normal, being oddly restrained and almost emotionless for much of the film. For me, that approach fit the character, given his profession and eventual revelations about his personality. The other three principles--Kinnear, Romijn-Stamos and Bright--were good in my view, but again I can see where some viewers could interpret their performances negatively. To me, however, all of the obvious problems stem from direction and editing, not the actors' work.The biggest problem seems to stem from director Nick Hamm's comments about the horror/thriller genre. He has stated, ""what was interesting to me about Godsend was that the horror and the suspense had nothing to do with anything supernatural or spiritual"". Hamm isn't a very big fan of the fantasy aspect of horror, which to me, translates into not being a very big horror fan. This led to trying to create a horror film where suspense arises out of realist drama and psychological situations. The realist drama in Godsend tends to be very slow and relatively uneventful--just as one might expect from someone not really wanting to make a horror film. Psychological horror is barely approached. There just isn't enough that happens. There are two potential villains, but neither does much. It would be very difficult to call either ""evil"".Kinnear and Romijn-Stamos aren't given enough to work with. They don't have anything very meaty to react to. Hamm seems too afraid to leave realist drama territory, at least in terms of the overall plot/action. That makes some of their ""horrified"" reactions seem shallow or false. Worse, Hamm doesn't seem to know how to cut horror films very well. Scenes go on far longer than they should, and occasionally almost seem as if we're seeing a bit of the footage either before Hamm said ""Action"" or after he called ""Cut"". A prime example of this is the scene near the end when Romijn-Stamos is walking through woods toward a shed.Godsend is also one of the few cases where copious DVD extras may have hurt the film more than helped. The DVD contains four alternate endings, averaging about 12 minutes long each. These occasionally deviate strongly from the theatrical ending, but none seem quite satisfying (all of the more nihilistic endings that Hamm described on his commentary but which apparently weren't shot would have done the trick for me; I also liked the filmed tag suggesting a sequel). They all tend to drag on, an impression that isn't helped by the lack of a score and a sound effects soundtrack.Also curious, given Hamm's dislike of the fantasy aspects of genre films, is the fact that the crux of the ""twist"" in Godsend is extremely loopy. What's happening with Adam makes little sense from a realistic/scientific standpoint, and how it happened just isn't possible. Of course, I'm not averse to fantasy, and I don't subtract points for elements in film that are wildly divergent from our beliefs and understanding of the actual world. But if Hamm is going to abandon realism when it comes to important plot points, why not abandon it wholesale, so that we can maybe see a film that deserves an A instead?",BrandtSponseller20,February/2005,7," Has potential, but it's a bit like watching molasses in January",1,"[lose, son, adam, cameron, bright, freak, accident, paul, greg, kinnear, jessie,

Godsend (2004) - IMDb,"I guess this film didn't really grip me. You knew from the start where the film was heading, but it seemed to take its sweet time about getting there. Perhaps that's why I found myself nodding off several times, only to be awoken by the obligatory, and repeated use of, shock tactics throughout the film.I can't really think of anything positive to say about this film, but neither can I say anything greatly negative. It was neither good, nor bad. In fact, watching it was very much like being trapped in limbo. There was little to stimulate the audience's minds through most of the movie.It's also irritating to see Hollywood moralising about the evils of cloning through the use of film.

Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. If there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. The film's unlikely hero is Quill (Chris Pratt), an eccentric gunfighter in the Han Solo mould who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil warlord Ronan. When he dispatches his top assassin, the green- skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), to recover the artifact, the pair find themselves locked up, along with the galaxy's most unlikely bounty hunters – a gun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick (Vin Diesel) who just happens to be a walking tree. All the actors do a great job at portraying there characters, they feel real beings. You get to know about them and their struggles and you become attached to them. Every character in the movie got their time to shine, especially Rocket Raccoon who is voiced perfectly by Bradley Cooper. Everyone is pitch perfect in their roles even Batista! For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well. What really can't be stressed enough is just how insanely fun and entertaining Guardians of the Galaxy is for literally its entire two-hour-plus run-time.

Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) - IMDb,"The plot was predictable. The characters aren't original. I guess the younger crowd and die hard fans will probably like it but as an avid movie fan Guardians kind of disappointed me. Acting was kind of terrible too. Bautista played Drax as if Drax was TRYING to sound intelligent. He couldn't pull off the smart brute. Zoe tried too hard to be bad a$$ and it wasn't natural. The Collector... Don't get me started... What reason was there for The Collector to even open and show anybody the Infinity Stone? It's a super powerful object that he knew was very powerful, why show Thanos' daughter or the outlaw? The bad guys were the worst, so campy. Ronin reminded me of a pro wrestler during an interview. Like Ultimate Warrior on a rant. Only good acting came from Thanos and Rocket. Yep, the CGIs. The final battle was whack. The ships lined up to form a net to stop the super ship and the good guy ships were below shooting bad guy ships who we're dive bombing the city. The worst was when they tried to replicate that scene in Avengers when Hulk was slamming Loki around but instead it was Groot shooting his tendrils through a bunch of bad guys and skewering them then slamming them unnecessarily back and forth against walls. The ending was so cheesy when John C Reiley was all sappy about his wife and kid being saved who they showed in the end as a woman and her daughter who earlier was part of a scene where they were almost crushed.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) - IMDb,"Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.I finally got round to watching the first film and was blown away. It had a remarkable charm that even the other Marvel titles didn't have. It was filled with great humour, memorable moments and fit into the Marvel Universe long running story perfectly.Because of this I pumped by expectations up high for the sequel to a degree where it was almost guaranteed to fail yet somehow, someway it didn't.Not only did it meet my expectations but it exceeded them, GotG2 is amazing.Full of the same five star humour, being a visual treat and once again with an excellent soundtrack the film gripped me from the outset and delivered that charm all over again.This time including several industry veterans including Kurt Russell (Who has been on great form since his return) and Sylvester Stallone they fit in well and don't detract from the franchise as I feared they might.With cameo appearances along the way from the likes of Farscape (1999) lead Ben Browder to industry legend Seth Green as Howard the Duck this is a fun rollercoaster ride than left me positively gagging for more.This is one of those films I feel like I could rant about (In a positive way) for a while and so I'm going to resist the urge and merely say that Guardians 2 is a contender for the best Marvel movie, contested only by the first Avengers film.Masterpiece.The Good:Cast are great againCharm returnsExcellent nostalgic soundtrackLooks amazingThe Bad:Only one movie with Baby Groot?

Haider (2014) - IMDb,"HAIDER to me is an acronym that means the following:H. Haunting. Be it in its background score, music, lyrics, playback (especially Rekha Bharadwaj, Sukhwinder Singh, and Arijit Singh), cinematography, or backdrop of Kashmir in 1995, Haider is Haunting, and how! The film will stay with you long after you have left the theater.A. Astounding. Haider is an astoundingly adept adaptation of a classic written almost 415 years ago that can be enjoyed irrespective of your knowledge about the Shakespearean Tragedy - Hamlet. If you don't know Hamlet, great! You do? Even better! I. Incredible. Haider is incredible - in terms of its performances. Be it that of Shahid Kapoor (Haider/Hamlet) who performs a complex role with the kind of award worthy chutzpah that should silence all his detractors once and for all. Or for that matter the the triumvirate of Tabu (Halala/Gertrude) - ethereal, dauntless, and supreme, Kay Kay Menon (Khurram/Claudius) - terrific, resolute, and subtle or Irfan Khan (Rooh/The Ghost of Hamlet's father) - rudimentary and underplayed. Not to be forgotten is Shraddha Kapoor (Aarshi/Ophelia) who pitches in a performance that is 'picture'esque perfect and so full of finesse. And of course the two Salman Khan's who are fans of the superstar and who will surely gain some fans of their own post this film. In fact, every single member of the cast pitches in a perfect performance here, irrespective of the role and duration.D. Daring. Haider is daring in talking about issues that many wouldn't touch with a bargepole and for the way it has juxtaposed a Shakespearean tragedy with a human tragedy - Kashmir. The valley is a character here that finally finds a voice of its own. The interpretations of that voice are truly brilliant.E. Effective. Sometimes experimentation and reinterpretations fail. Not here. With layer upon layer waiting for the audience to be interpreted (for example the touch of Oedipal complex between a mother and son, the growing of guilt of a well meaning lover, the song of the gravediggers, the examples of 'Chutzpah' and its comparison with AFSPA etc). Haider is effective on multiple levels and truly faultless in its execution.R. Rooh (Spirit/Soul). This is a film with an indomitable spirit that filmmakers would die to include in their body of work, and which Vishal Bharadwaj effectively manages to in this lifetime. This film has that which many a masterpiece may sometimes lack - a soul.

Half Past Dead (2002) - IMDb,"Oh dear! What can I say about Half Past Dead? I was really disappointed in it. I was thinking....A Steven Seagal movie! Cool! We'll get to see him kick people and flip people and break bones. We might even get to see him have a stick fight with somebody! Excellent!However, I was in for a rude awakening. This film can be summed up as follows:Take an episode of the A-Team, remove the lovable and roguish characters such as Murdoch, Hannibal, Mr T and Face. Then get a writer/director to pen a plot even Ed Wood would be ashamed of and who's too big a fan of The Matrix and John Woo movies for his own good. Throw in a bunch of people with really bad acting ability and who don't have real names. Finally, add in a main star who's getting saggy around the midriff and doesn't appear to be able to do his own stunts anymore. The result? Half Past Dead. An action movie so ridiculous that it at least made me smile right the way through. The plot holes are stupendously, glaringly large - for example, prisoners who, when the jail is invaded, fight the invaders rather than attempting to escape. Or how about the prison itself, which has an armoury that contains heavy machineguns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers? You also have a helicopter (bearing a striking resemblance to a Huey) with some kind of video game machinegun mounted in the nose.Then there's Seagal himself. I like the guy. He CAN fight. He's even witty in a way that Jean-Claude Van Damme will never be. But all through the movie I kept hoping for that one great, defining fight scene. Never happened. Instead we got people firing guns a lot and not hitting a whole Hell of a lot. I mean, when someone runs down a narrow corridor and you fire a sub-machinegun at them, there isn't a whole lot of places the bullets can go other than down the corridor and into the target. Yet somehow they miss? Even the A-Team would cringe at this foolishness. And then when it gets to any kind of one-on-one physical stuff, we get treated to a shabby Matrix rip-off, without the benefit of bullet-time. People getting kicked twenty feet through the air and sundry other ludicrous acrobatic nonsense.C'mon Steven, you're better than this. Your career can't be over. Say it ain't so!This is instantly forgettable (except I'm forcing myself to remember for the purposes of this review) and if you watch it, try to find it amusing in an A-Team kind of way.

Happy New Year (2014) - IMDb,"Happy New Year is a 'fultoo masala entertainer' that does not pretend to be anything else. The story is essentially about Charlie, played by Shah Rukh Khan and his 'angels' who plan to pull off the worlds biggest heist. But here's a catch - by participating in the world's biggest Dance Competition.What makes the movie tick is Farah Khan and her constant references/ode to Bollywood films. Be it Shah Rukh repeating (albeit with a twist) dialogues of his blockbuster films, or Abhishek's vomit inducing yet rib tickling performance (a dauntless double role), she hits the nail on the head. Deepika Padukone as the Dance Instructor Mohini, whose heart beats for the English speaking Khan is splendid as is her dancing! Boman Irani as a middle aged Parsi chick magnet is funny, Sonu Sood as a slightly deaf bomb specialist lights up the screen with his style of muscular action, and Vivaan Shah as the Hacker shows promise. Jackie Shroff as the master villain and Anupam Kher in an emotional appearance bring in the seriousness that is required.There are a host of special appearances that light up the screen as does the spectacular cinematography. My favorites being Prabhu Deva, Sajid Khan, Anurag Kashyap-Vishal, and the hilarious Kiku Sharda doing a Saroj Khan and the lookalike of Narendra Modi. Malaika Arora Khan, Dino Morea, and Geeta Kapoor playing themselves add to the recall value.That the movie is thankfully not a copy paste and merely references other films, in the process charting its own unpredictable course, is sure to light up your face as it does the screen. This being a dance film, the choreography by Farah and Geeta is actually damn good! Especially the sequences that bring out the terrible dancing of the actors. The heist portions are in comparison slick and stylized, and thankfully explained in minute detail.What transpires is more due to luck than planning, and sometimes highly improbable. But the lack of logic and reason is mostly overshadowed by the antics of the stars who try to utilize the situation to the fullest, and turn it to their advantage! At almost three hours, the movie could have been shorter, the music more melodious (save for 'Manwa Lage' - a soothing ditty and the hilarious 'Nonsense Ki Night'), and the explanations not as repetitive at times. But then no one said this movie was perfect! However what it is indeed, is a perfect entertainer for those seeking to have a good time and their money's worth at the theaters.Recommended for the Manmohan Desai fans who like the zany Farah Khan brand of Bollywood that's more for the masses than the classes. It has stars oozing appeal (read SRK, Deepika, and Abhishek) and can truly turn a dull boring weekend into a fun theater experience.In short - a movie that could have been crappy, but instead manages to make the viewers happy! A must watch for those who like their movies dished Bollywood style and of course for fans of Shah Rukh who with an 8 pack really does reinvent himself physically at this age while doing everything else as only he can.P.S: Viewer discretion required.

Harakiri (1962) - IMDb,"I saw Harakiri (Seppuku) in a new 35 mm print at NYC's Film Forum. This is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture. Writers Shinobu Hashimoto and Yasuhiko Takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" Ambrose Bierce and Howard Hawks' Westerns as much as by samurai literature and movies.The film begins deceptively as a story within a story, seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor, such as in the conventional, oft-retold tale of ""The 47 Ronin."" The context is set at a time when the central government, the shogunate, is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people, notably their samurai, forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse. But the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from Hiroshima.Very gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale, as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tension.It is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity, where a priority is put on family, support, education and creative productivity. In comparison to the macho opening relationships, with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy, a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual. Seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier, ritualized scenes in sharp relief, particularly the recurring image of the clan's armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbol.The psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence. Even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks, the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure. And those are just the overwhelming cultural resonances that a 21st century American can glean. Like ""Downfall (Der Untergang),"" it reveals the inhumane mentality that led to World War II.The repeating motif of long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes the stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps the characters. The revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional Japanese art, including drops of blood like first snow flakes then a waterfall.The over all effect of this masterpiece is emotionally draining.",noralee16,September/2005,10, Samurai Genre is Used to Exposively Indict Japanese Politics and Culture,1,"[saw, harakiri, seppuku, new, mm, print, nyc, film, forum, brilliant, use, narrow, period, genre, explosively, indict, politics, culture, writer, shinobu, hashimoto, yasuhiko, takiguchi, surely, must, inspire, count, monte, cristo, ambrose, bierce, howard, hawk, western, much, samurai, literature, film, begin, deceptively, story, within, story, seemingly, provide, traditional, example, uphold, samurai, honor, conventional, tale, ronin, context, set, time, central, government, shogunate, supplant, local, clan, arbitrarily, unemploying, thousand, people, notably, samurai, force, mercenary, mode, ronin, best, beg, food, bad, parallel, century, make, repeatedly, explicit, samurai, come, clan, seek, help, gradually, get, insight, tale, within, tale, see, flashback, within, flashback, character, confrontation, get, uneasy, ...]","[i, saw, harakiri, seppuku, in, new, 35 mm print, at, nyc, film forum, is, a brilliant use, of, a narrow period genre, to, explosively indict, politics and culture, writers, shinobu hashimoto, yasuhiko takiguchi, surely must have been, as, inspired, by, the count, of, monte cristo, ambrose bierce and howard hawks, westerns, as much, as by, literature and movies.the film, begins, deceptively, as, a story, within, a story, seemingly providing, a traditional example, of, upholding, honor, such, as in, the conventional, oft-retold tale, of, the 47 ronin, the context, is set, at, a time, when, the central government, the shogunate, is supplanting, local clans, arbitrarily unemploying thousands, of, people, notably, their, forcing, them, into, the mercenary mode, of, ronin, at, best, begging, for, food, at, worse, the parallels, to, the 20th century, are made, repeatedly explicit, as, comes, to, this clan, seeking help is, from, hiroshima.very gradually we, get, further insight, on, the tale, within, a tale, as, we, see, more flashbacks, within, flashbacks, ...]",112.18263350560451,-31.681615741632548,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,1,1,4,0,5,5,4,6.662162162162162,222,257,saw harakiri seppuku new 35 mm print nycs film forum brilliant use narrow period genre explosively indict politics culture writers shinobu hashimoto yasuhiko takiguchi surely must inspired count monte cristo ambrose bierce howard hawks westerns much samurai literature movies film begins deceptively story within story seemingly providing traditional example upholding samurai honor conventional oft retold tale 47 ronin context set time central government shogunate supplanting local clans arbitrarily unemploying thousands people notably samurai forcing mercenary mode ronin best begging food worse parallels 20th century made repeatedly explicit samurai comes clan seeking help hiroshima gradually insight tale within tale flashbacks within flashbacks character confrontations uneasy inklings moral story may appears first stakes higher higher almost unbearable tension almost halfway film female suddenly alternative model masculinity priority put family support education creative productivity comparison macho opening relationships emphasis formal militaristic loyalty hierarchy loving husband father practically metrosexual seeing stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds grandbaby puts earlier ritualized scenes sharp relief particularly recurring image clans armor seems less less imposing finally destroyed empty symbol psychological tension confrontations last third film excruciating actual violence even thought already knew outcome flashbacks layers perception relationships personalities agonizingly peeled away thrust sword reveal depths horrifying hypocrisy political social structure overwhelming cultural resonances 21st century american glean like downfall der untergang reveals inhumane mentality led world war ii repeating motif long walks confrontations empty corridors emphasizes stultifying bureaucratic maze entraps characters revenge motifs accented startlingly beautiful cinematography recalls traditional japanese art including drops blood like first snow flakes waterfall effect masterpiece emotionally draining,0.0639831257178196,0.4418485142974938,1
Hard Boiled (1992) - IMDb,"Hard Boiled is my number 1 favorite Hong Kong John Woo action film that I love to death! I absolutely love this movie to death I love it. It is one of my personal favorite movies. Hard Boiled (1992) is literally John Woo's best Hong Kong action film ever made of all time! The movie is a hard-core action, I have ever seen. It is actually the best Hong Kong action film for me. It belongs right up there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) the best action classic film of all time. Chow Yun-Fat, toothpick in mouth, a gun in each hand. That's all of the plot you need to know. In fact, this is THE best pure action epic ever filmed. This is my film, my personal favorite Hong Kong action film of all time.""Give the guy a gun and he's superman, give him two and he's God.""Not even Jackie Chan can mess with this film or beat it. The only Jackie Chan film that is close to this film is Police Story. In my opinion Hard Boiled is John Woo's best HK action movie from the 90's and a true masterpiece along with Hard Target (1993) his first American movie with Jean-Claude Van Damme in the main role. Chow Yun-Fat stars as Tequila, a cop hell-bent on bringing down the gun smugglers responsible for his partner's death. He teams up with an undercover cop Tony Leung whose secret identity as a Triad hit man hangs on thread.Hard Boiled is my favorite John Woo's HK action movies. This action movie with twists around, The Hong Kong Cinema Hard Boiled has everything in it, no CGI, the stunts are real, the explosions are bigger and the plot of the film is amazing you can get in to the story without guessing what is going to happened and what the plot is about. The warehouse scenes and a shooting a motorcycles in an explosions from Tequila is my favorite scenes in the movie. Sometimes to me it come for this movie is similar to Miami Vice when Tony Leung was undercover cop on a boat he remind me on Sonny Crockett, but the shout outs in this film are awesome. Just Miami Vice TV series where more about drug cartels, this is arms dealer weapons about triads. The stunts are real and very dangerous. There was a hospital siege which was actually Die Hard in a hospital. Hard Boiled is a classic action film from Hong Kong, they don't make movies like this anymore. Phillip Chan is also in this film which I forgot to mention in my review Philip Chan was also in Van Damme's Bloodsport. You have a great action sequences in the tea house, where the guns are hitting in the bird cage, he shoots a dozen guys and saves a baby, the hospital sequences are real. The first time I saw this film I had no idea that how great film it is, the greatest movie of all time in the cinema. John Woo is also as a bartender in this film. The hospital sequences for me is real, the action is real. The best Chow Yun-Fat and John Woo movie ever made. Hard Boiled is a 1992 Hong Kong action film written by Barry Wong and directed by John Woo.

Hard Boiled (1992) - IMDb,"There can be few cop movies which can boast a body count higher than Spielberg's entire Omaha Beach Landing in the first 5 minutes. Possibly no cop film except, of course, Hard Boiled.Hard Boiled is John Woo's Hong Kong swansong, and many regard it as his finest film. It stars young Chow Yun-Fat and Tony Leung Chiu Wai, two of the finest actors in Hong Kong; the usual ""maverick cop hunts big boss bad guy"" routine; oh, and lots and lots of blood. Imagine a slightly more realistic version of the Arnie midi-gun sequence in T2  more realistic in that when someone starts firing a midi-gun and blowing up cars, the cops get killed. That, in a nutshell, is the plot of Hardboiled. All two hours and six minutes of it.The plot  well that makes about as much sense as a wolverine in a fruit salad, but I'm not sure addicts of HK Cinema care too much about that. Tequila (maverick cop and certified nutcase with a heart of gold - Chow Yun Fat) shouts and swears at his boss, shoots up bad guys, gets drunk and ends up (implausibly, if iconically) in a hospital, holding a baby in one hand and a shot gun in the other. Tony Leung lives Miami Vice-Style on a boat (alas, no Alligator) while committing murder, getting paid by the HK Police, and wearing loose tee-shirts with white jackets.If all this sounds like style over substance  erm that's 'cos it is.The film definitely has its moments. In fact, like most John Woo films, it seems mostly to be a series of moments strung together to feature length. It also has some real grit. I appreciated the scene where a regular cop kills an undercover cop by mistake in a raid. Realistic, and not something that Hollywood would ever broach (the closest to this is in a truly class film like The Reservoir Dogs).However, while this is a true Hong Kong bullets and ballet classic, Western audiences are likely to feel slightly cheated by its totally bonkers story. Less bonkers than many, perhaps, but that's not really saying much.I enjoyed it. It was a guilty pleasure, but I'm man enough to admit I enjoyed it. John Woo has yet to make a better film. And has never yet made a sensible one, so don't blame him or me if you find it a bit daft. 5/10 (but watchable).",j30bell22,December/2004,5," Bullets, ballet and bloodletting.

Hell Ride (2008) - IMDb,"The first time I watched this movie I wasn't sure I liked it.It seemed very cheesy and over the top. I didn't like the way they seemed to be trying to be like the 60's and 70's biker movies.I missed the point the first time I saw it.But there were some scenes I wanted to see again, because I had watched it late one night and didn't finish it, so I watched it a second time and I must say I liked it a little more. The next day I found myself thinking about it and wanting to watch it again to see some of the sections over again.So I watched it a third time, and not on my veranda as I had the night before, but in my private office/study and paid attention to every scene. I must say it really grew on me.It reminded me of the movie Natural Born Killers. You either 'got it' or you didn't. You either loved it or hated it.Now I read all 11 pages of reviews and I can see the film students are out in force, but this was not a film that was going to follow what your professors told you about plot and plot development. Or script writing and some other things that people seem to want to 'act' like are part of making art films.I digress.However, having made a few micro and low budget films, and being in many small budget ones as an actor, I can tell you that this movie had flavor. It was, as someone else said on another review, a movie about biker movies.It had sex, but never showed anyone HAVING sex. It showed a lots of T & A, but nothing so bad I would compare it to porn, and those that do are just not living in reality.Now, was it weird? Yes. Was it Oscar winning? No. Was is good entertainment? YES! I judge a movie by a few simple things. Was it entertaining is the primary goal I seek in a movie. This one passed with flying colors.The acting was NOT that bad. The chatter between the folks was right out of those macho, campy, films this one was inspired by. Anyone who doesn't see that doesn't understand the true 'B' movie and REALLY doesn't get Bishop's idea here.Not surprising in today's film world of computer generated images and gazillion dollar blockbusters but this is different.I will again state, if you see this movie at least three times, keep an open mind, leaving all your QT wannit-to-be at home, let yourself forget all the stupid (and usually wrong) stuff your film professor told you, and allow yourself to see a movie that was meant to be a 'B' movie about 'B' movies, in other words, fun and nothing else, you just might 'get it.' And for all the folks on here talking about all the stuff that was 'stolen' from other movies, I say, show me the super duper ultra original piece you flaunt as your ideal movie and I will find the movies they stole stuff from.It is a stupid argument and ignorant at the same time. Anyone who has ever made a REAL movie will tell you that everyone 'steals' from other movies, it's called inspiration.And for the folks calling the bikers 'un real' I can tell you that you have never been around true outlaw bikers before. And you have never been to a real outlaw biker party. They are hard drinking, hard screwing, hard riding, dudes you don't mess with. You would be very surprised at all the 'old dudes' getting laid by hot younger ladies too. I would love to see the yuppie Harley types show up at a real biker rally. Oh boy.I digress again.To those who haven't seen this, don't listen to the nay sayers, see for yourself. You just might be one of the folks that 'gets it.'

Hell Ride (2008) - IMDb,"Larry Bishop writes, directs and stars in this soft-core porn; a plot less biker movie about nothing to do with anything. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I actually felt sorry for the girls in this movie (who probably thought they were in the making of a feature film). In all reality they're making a porno. They walk on set, spend three or four days there, say some sexually themed lines to a bunch of old men - thirty years older than them - then they take off their cloths and run around naked. I can only assume this was Larry Bishops only way of getting laid. You see shot after shot directly on girls asses. Shot after shot of Bishop walking up to some random chick and grabbing her by her crotch, as if he were shaking her hand. How this crap was even funded is beyond me. There isn't one redeeming quality, or one moment in the movie that creates any kind of reaction, or shows any inclination that these people had any idea of what they were doing. If you don't see naked women all that often, then I guess this movie would be for you. If you're eleven-years-old, you might like it. The acting is awful, the writing is awful, the production is awful, and the direction is awful. It's not even worth your time renting it just so you can say you witnessed the car crash.

Hell or High Water (2016) - IMDb,"Bank robberies have been featured in many hundreds of films since the early days of cinema: The Great Train Robbery for example dates back to 1903! More recent heist classics such as ""Oceans 11"", ""Die Hard"", ""Run Lola Run"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" tend towards the stylised end of the act. Where this film delivers interest is in aligning the protagonists' drivers with the banking and mortgage 'crimes' featured in last year's ""The Big Short"". Add in to the movie Nutribullet a soupçon of the West Texan setting from Arthur Penn's 1967 ""Bonnie and Clyde"", turn it on and you have ""Hell or High Water"".Chris Pine (""Star Trek"") and Ben Foster (""Inferno"", ""The Program"") play brothers Toby and Tanner Howard trying to rescue their deceased mother's ranch from being foreclosed on by Texas Midlands bank. Rather than taking one of the ""get out of debt"" offers advertised on billboards – cleverly and insistently introduced in long panning highway shots – the brothers have their own financial plan: a scheme that involves early morning raids of the cash drawers of small-town Texas Midlands branches. But the meticulous planning of Toby, as the calm and intelligent one, are constantly at risk of upset by the unpredictable and violent actions of the loose-cannon Tanner.Since the amounts of cash stolen are in the thousands rather than the millions, the FBI aren't interested and the case is handed instead by aged and grumpy Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges, ""True Grit"") and his partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham). The pair have a respectful relationship but one built around racial banter, with Hamilton constantly referring to Alberto's Mexican/Comanche heritage. A cat and mouse game ensues with the lawmen staking out the most likely next hits. The sonorous cello strings of the soundtrack portend a dramatic finale, and we as viewers are not disappointed.The performances of the main leads are all excellent, with Chris Pine given the chance to show more acting chops than he has had chance to with his previous Kirk/Jack Ryan characters. His chemistry with Ben Foster is just sublime. Similarly, Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham make for a formidable double act. It is Jeff Bridges though who has the standout performance and one that is Oscar nominated for Best Supporting Actor. (In fact with Michael Shannon also getting nominated in the same category for ""Nocturnal Animals"", we can add 'West Texan lawman' to 'Holocaust movies' (a Winslet ""Extras"" reference there!) as the prime bait for Oscar nomination glory!)The real winner here though is the whip-smart screenplay by Taylor Sheridan (""Sicario"") which sizzles with great lines: lines that make you grin inanely at the screen regularly through the running time.""In your last days in the nursing home, you'll think of me and giggle"" schmoozes Tanner to the pretty hotel check-in girl: a come-on clearly worth remembering as it delivers the goods, as it were.The trick here is in building up a degree of empathy and sympathy for the characters on both sides. The 'bad guys' here are successfully portrayed as the banks. Before the 2017 awards, you could get 25/1 odds on this winning the Best Original Screenplay Oscar – but I would personally rate it right up there with ""Manchester by the Sea"".Deftly directed by Scot David Mackenzie (""Starred Up"") this is a film (the first of two!) that might well have elbowed it's way into my Top 10 of 2016 if I'd seen it during its cinema release.

Hell or High Water (2016) - IMDb,"If the whole plot basis of a film is that someone who owns an asset that can generate 600 thousand dollars a year can't raise 40 thousand dollars to pay off the loan on it, then you really beggar belief. Why would anyone take part in several armed robberies and risk frying on an electric chair rather than spending 30 minutes with a half decent financial adviser is preposterous. If you can suspend disbelief over the ludicrous plot then what do we make of the rest of the film.

Henry V (1989) - IMDb,"""Henry V"" marks Kenneth Branagh's greatest achievement to date. Branagh not only directs this rich and visually stunning film, he stars as the title character. The movie opens with Derek Jacobi (Branagh's Shakespearean mentor) in modern garb passionately delivering the prologue. Then we are taken into the dark, dank rooms of Henry's castle. The king makes his dramatic entrance, complete with a Darth Vader style cape. The entire film is filled with grandeur and pomp, with any faults in the story line being attributable more to Shakespeare himself than Branagh. Henry V as I remember it from my college English class is a decidingly pro-British play (and film). There is little question that France should be conquered, and Henry speaks of his war against France as if it were France that attacked England. Indeed, Henry's famous ""St. Chrispin's day speech"" is so rousing, that it has been quoted often and inspired the name of the ""Band of Brothers"" miniseries about World War II. This is no surprise, since Shakespeare's prose is famously beautiful.There is definitely a difference in the way that both sides of the conflict are presented. The French, at least in Branagh's movie are presented as arrogant (and somewhat effeminate), while on the side of the English, even children are filled with manly courage. Henry is presented as noble, fair, and merciful. True he threatens the mayor of one French town, telling him that if he does not surrender the town, the English will do terrible things to its residents, but does not carry out his threat. He also hangs the one English soldier who steals from a French church, refusing to show favoritism for him just because he was his friend. Apparently mercy towards your own countrymen was not a virtue that Henry saw particularly important.The films greatest attribute is its soundtrack, particularly the use of music in the scene following the battle of Agincourt in which the warring parties collect their dead for burial.All in all, a fascinating look inside the mind of a king.",artemis_57,December/2004,10, A Kingly Feast for the Eyes and Ears,1,"[henry, v, mark, kenneth, branagh, great, achievement, date, branagh, directs, rich, visually, stun, film, star, title, character, movie, open, derek, jacobi, branagh, shakespearean, mentor, modern, garb, passionately, deliver, prologue, take, dark, dank, room, henry, castle, king, make, dramatic, entrance, complete, darth, vader, style, cape, entire, film, fill, grandeur, pomp, fault, story, line, attributable, shakespeare, branagh, henry, v, remember, college, english, class, decidingly, play, film, little, question, france, conquer, henry, speaks, war, france, france, attack, england, indeed, henry, famous, chrispin, day, speech, rouse, quote, often, inspire, name, band, brother, miniseries, world, war, ii, surprise, since, shakespeare, prose, famously, definitely, difference, way, ...]","[henry v, marks, kenneth branagh, greatest achievement, to, date, branagh, not only directs, rich and, visually stunning film, he, stars, as, the title character, the movie, opens, with, derek jacobi, branagh, shakespearean mentor, in, modern garb, passionately delivering, the prologue, then, we, are taken, into, the dark, dank rooms, of, henry, castle, the king, makes, his dramatic entrance, complete, with, a darth vader style cape, the entire film, is filled, with, grandeur and pomp, with, any faults, in, the story line, being, attributable more, to, shakespeare, himself, than, branagh, henry v, as, i remember it, from, my college english class, is, a decidingly pro-british play, film, is, little question, that, france, should be conquered, henry speaks, of, his war, against, france, as if, it, were, france, that, attacked, england, indeed, henry, famous, st, chrispin, day speech, is, so rousing, that, it, has been quoted, often, inspired, the name, of, band, of, brothers, miniseries, about, world war ii, ...]",8.688821292632078,-11.827039023782936,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,6.161073825503356,149,181,henry v marks kenneth branaghs greatest achievement date branagh directs rich visually stunning film stars title character movie opens derek jacobi branaghs shakespearean mentor modern garb passionately delivering prologue taken dark dank rooms henrys castle king makes dramatic entrance complete darth vader style cape entire film filled grandeur pomp faults story line attributable shakespeare branagh henry v remember college english class decidingly pro british play film little question france conquered henry speaks war france france attacked england indeed henrys famous st chrispins day speech rousing quoted often inspired name band brothers miniseries world war ii surprise since shakespeares prose famously beautiful definitely difference way sides conflict presented french least branaghs movie presented arrogant somewhat effeminate side english even children filled manly courage henry presented noble fair merciful true threatens mayor french town telling surrender town english terrible things residents carry threat hangs english soldier steals french church refusing show favoritism friend apparently mercy towards countrymen virtue henry saw particularly important films greatest attribute soundtrack particularly use music scene following battle agincourt warring parties collect dead burial fascinating look inside mind king,0.1705952380952381,0.5316666666666667,1
Henry V (1989) - IMDb,"Derek Jacobi's wonderfully proud, winking Chorus and Patrick Doyle's interesting (but barely) score are the sole redeeming features of this early Kenneth Branagh misfire. A gritty (in a BBC sense of the word) take on Shakespeare's mostly tedious historical play, ""Henry V"" gives far too much power to one man in the worst way that Branagh repeated so often to such bewildering acclaim. He not only directs and, rather pretentiously, ""adapts for the screen"" the words of the Bard, but also plays the title character. And sadly, he is by far no Olivier. The man has talent, to be sure, but it either wasn't here yet or it had fled temporarily when he took up this triple task. The only ""flat, unraised spirit"" here is Branagh himself, who essays a monotonous monarch with all the emotional depth of Keanu Reeves after an all-nighter. He even fumbles his one good instinct as a filmmaker: flashing back to ""Henry IV"" is an excellent way to provide backstory for people who aren't too familiar with the soap opera nature of some of Shakespeare's histories (which is primarily important here for the character of Falstaff), but the technique doesn't mesh with the rest of the picture. And why keep the Chorus? He's a purely theatrical device. He's there to tell us we have to imagine that we're in France or Southampton-- a necessity of the theater, in which all you can see is a stage and what's on it, but somewhat disconcerting in a film because the entire point of a film is to show us someplace we normally wouldn't see. Did he keep the Chorus to make his job, as a director, of sustaining our illusion that much easier? Whatever the motives (and no disrespect to the vibrant Jacobi), it was not the right decision. It's a boring, slow-to-evolve adaptation of a terrible, impossible-to-read play. (I am a fan of ol' Will, but his history plays are some of the most tedious dramas ever to plague the page.) If you're a fan of the kind of epic battle scenes of films as diverse as ""Platoon"" and ""Gladiator,"" you'll definitely enjoy that aspect of the movie. Action-wise, it has its moments. But after a while, you just want Branagh to stick to doing one thing.

Hera Pheri (2000) - IMDb,"I never expected much from this movie, because of the cast: Fading Sunil Shetty, sabseboringKhiladi/monkeyboy Akki and serious Tabu. The only hope i had was in Paresh Rawal. After seeing him in the hilarious Andaz Apna Apna (Highly recommended), he was to be taken notice of.So when I did watch it I was shocked to say the least. I found Hera Pheri to be one the best comedies of the decade. Just forget about the cheap attempts of David Dhawan called comedy. This is the real deal.The story is simple (as is with many good movies). The 3 protagonists Shyam (Sunil Shetty), Raju (Akshay Kumar) and Babu Rao (Paresh Rawal) are all in dire need of money. Shyam needs it to pay back an old friend (Om Puri) so he can get his(as in Puri's) sister married. Raju needs it for his mother and Babu Rao to pay back loans his father took. When a local rich man's grand daughter gets kidnapped by 'dangerous' gangster Kabira (Gulshan Grover) calls Babu Rao's number by mistake, Raju sees an end to all their problems. He suggests they play a game, do some hera pheri. And the movie is off to take you for an awesome ride.Performances by far surprised me. Sunil Shetty I never liked, but his performance as the somewhat naive do-gooder was wonderful. Akki ape also surprised me in his sense of comedic timing. But Paresh was the biggest surprise. Even though he was my only hope for this movie, he came out ten times better than I expected. He deserved the best comedian Filmfare Award, that he did receive for 2000. Tabu (Anu) as another person in need of money who fights with Shyam for a job is also competent. It is a small role but as always she leaves her mark. Asrani in a tiny role also gives some laughs. Om Puri was also excellent in his small role.So Bravo Priyadarshan saheb! Once again you've shown that you are a unique and intelligent filmmaker with a lot of tricks up your sleeve. One tip though, don't think too much about the logic of the story or the probability. Just turn off your brain for a few hours and enjoy.

The effusive praise by many reviewers on this board calling it the best or funniest movie ever is completely lost on me.

Hero (2002) - IMDb,"It is impossible to avoid comparing Zhang Yimou's `Hero' to Ang Lee's `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'  They were both big-budget Chinese kung-fu films with breathtaking cinematography of Chinese landscape and a cast of super-stars. But aside from the obvious, there is in fact nothing else to compare. `Hero' fails to deliver on almost every level that really matters, proving that big-name stars, beautiful scenery, and action effects are no replacement for a director's artistry and vision.All the marketing hype preceding the premier of `Hero' has done nothing more than make its failure a spectacular one.  Much anticipated, `Hero' drew movie-goers in throngs when it first opened at theaters in mainland China and Hong Kong, making it an instant box-office success. However, though the script pleased government censors, Chinese audiences went to newfound heights of caustic criticism and sarcastic wit to express their disdain. On-line critics, both professional and amateur, proclaimed the film `ideologically disturbing,' `from the viewpoint of deep servitude,' written `either by an amateur historian, or someone with ulterior motives.' One article was simply titled, `Hero, you make me sick!'The deepest failing of the film is in its plot, which is not only morally reprehensible, and based on unforgivable historic fallacy but - worst of all for a film - is boring! All blockbuster epic films are known to take some liberties with the facts of history, but `Hero' goes beyond artistic license into unforgivable ignorance when it attempts to glorify an emperor that was as brutal as Stalin or Hitler. `Hero' does not make up for this lack of moral compass by being entertaining or fun.  Instead, it is makes a woefully poor attempt at being `deep' and merely manages to be pretentious and preachy.Though historians agree that the First Emperor of China was ruthlessly violent, Mao Zedong was known to have admired this ruler - no surprise, given Mao's own tyrannical rule.  Likewise, the Communist government in Beijing sees the allegory that can easily be drawn between the First Emperor and its own iron-fist methods, so they were particularly pleased with this latest work by Zhang Yimou. Tony Leung, one of the stars of `Hero' remarked during an interview to promote the film that the Beijing government had done the right thing in 1989 by crushing the student demonstrations, because it was needed to maintain `stability' in China.  For these remarks, Tony Leung received shocked criticisms in his home city of Hong Kong, but he merely stated out loud the underlying message of the movie.Director Zhang Yimou has stated that his goal was to surpass the values of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kung-fu novels and movies, to reveal a higher wisdom. Unfortunately, his version of `wisdom' turns out to be: THE OPPRESSOR IS RIGHT. In China, where thousands of years of historical reality have rammed this message through, art was the last sanctuary where the individual could actually find freedom from such tyranny. The great popularity of the kung-fu novel can be explained by its ability to provide an escape into an alternate world: one where kung-fu warriors roamed the country seeking adventure and fighting for justice, free from fear and winning against all odds with their super-human skills. Only in the novel did the individual ever win over institutionalized power in China, and only in the novel did the oppressed find their champions. Going against this tradition of the kung-fu hero, Zhang Yimou has not gone upwards towards a higher truth, as he had hoped, but downwards, to the level of government propaganda.  It's no wonder the government was so pleased.Some film lovers may secretly wonder, `All moralistic judgments aside, is it at least entertaining?'  Fortunately, the answer is a resounding `No!' Because the same tale is told over and over with only slight variations, it becomes tedious to watch. Moreover, the three conflicting versions of the same story serves only to confuse the character development, since it leaves precious little time for the viewer to feel any sympathy for any of them once the `real' version emerges.The film is not without its beautiful images. However, all the scenes fall flat because they do not connect to or enhance the storyline. The use of different colors to distinguish the separate versions of the tale comes across as simplistic and contrived, and the cinematography appears self-consciously rather than truly beautiful. Great for a trailer, but a disappointment once you are there to watch the entire film.For those in China who showed disdain for `Crouching Tiger's' unrealistic kung-fu, much was expected from `Hero.' Jet Li, who plays the title role, is a real kung-fu artist who held national titles before beginning his career as an actor.  His previous movies have revealed limited acting abilities, but many hoped that Zhang Yimou could use Li's lithe body movements to full effect while casting him properly in a role that would not task his acting abilities.  But it was not to be. `Hero' attempts to go beyond the kung-fu genre, so there are not many fighting scenes, and Jet Li is expected to perform a difficult piece of acting: an inner transformation leading to profound wisdom and self-sacrifice. As the casting director ought to have expected, Li fails miserably. Meanwhile, the only fighting scene that reveals any true kung-fu skill is the first one of the film, between Li and and Donnie Yen.  All the scenes that follow are a disappointment, so `Hero' fails to satisfy, even on that level.Though most audiences outside China are unlikely to be aware of the historical mangling of the story of the cruel First Emperor, it seems even more unlikely that they would accept Zhang's version of `Chinese wisdom,' which is anything but. Perhaps the only time an audience coming out of a screening of `Hero' was seen smiling - instead of yawning or frowning - was at the special screening for Chinese government

High Noon (1952) - IMDb,"John Wayne was totally wrong to call this movie un-American. Courage and cowardice are universal emotions, and the attitudes of the characters in High Noon are, I think, incredibly truthful and telling. I know that if I lived in the Wild West, had a job and family, and was asked to stand up and fight against a gang of gun-toting psychos I would probably not be able to do it. That's why Gary Cooper's Will Kane is such a remarkable character in terms of self-respect, morality and inner strength. It's the way he MUST uphold the law even though it will perhaps cost him his wife and his life. It is the various townfolk with whom most of us will identify, even if it makes us feel shame or unworthiness to admit it. No matter how bravely we act, nor how much we want to think heroically of ourselves, 90% of us would cower in the shadows when the time came to do what Will Kane does in this movie.On his wedding day, dependable lawman Will Kane (Gary Cooper) has just handed in his badge and is preparing to leave town with his bride Amy (Grace Kelly) when he receives devastating news. An old adversary, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), has been pardoned for crimes that he should have hanged for and is on his way to Kane's town of Hadleyville to get revenge. He is due on the noon train, leaving Kane one hour to either run for his life or make preparations to fight. Kane and Amy set off at full gallop, hoping to put some miles between themselves and danger, but Kane doesn't get far before he feels compelled to turn back. With the new sheriff not due for a day, he just can't let go of the extraordinary sense of duty and responsibility he feels towards his town. However when he gets back to town he gets quite a shock - for no-one has the guts (nor, in some instances, the inclination) to fight alongside him against the Miller gang. As time ticks unstoppably towards noon, Kane gradually realises that if he's going to stop Miller and his boys, he's going to have to do it alone!Cooper's performance is extremely powerful and he received a thoroughly deserved Oscar for it. Kelly is good as his bride, although many viewers will find her character hard to like. Lloyd Bridges has a brilliant early role as Kane's deputy, while the very best of the supporting pack is Katy Jurado as a Latino woman whose ""history"" with most of the men in town puts her in an unenviable position when the shooting starts. Fred Zinnemann directs the film outstandingly, making each scene fit into the grander scheme of things with literate precision. Any aspiring young film-maker wanting to learn how to pace a film correctly should watch High Noon with a close eye, for it is unparallelled as the most perfectly paced film of all-time. The music by Dmitri Tomkin - plus that incredible ballad ""Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling"" by Tex Ritter - is just one more element that makes High Noon one of the great masterpieces. There's nothing else to say - if you haven't already, go out and see this film NOW!",barnabyrudge16,April/2006,10, Remarkably well-organised western in which not one single second is wasted and the tension is built up admirably.,1,"[john, wayne, totally, wrong, call, movie, courage, cowardice, universal, emotion, attitude, character, high, noon, think, incredibly, truthful, tell, know, live, wild, west, job, family, ask, stand, fight, gang, psycho, would, probably, able, gary, cooper, kane, remarkable, character, term, morality, inner, strength, way, must, uphold, law, even, though, perhaps, cost, wife, life, various, townfolk, u, identify, even, make, us, feel, shame, unworthiness, admit, matter, bravely, act, much, want, think, heroically, us, would, cower, shadow, time, come, kane, wedding, day, dependable, lawman, kane, gary, cooper, hand, badge, prepare, leave, town, bride, amy, grace, kelly, receives, devastate, news, old, adversary, frank, miller, ian, ...]","[john wayne, was, totally wrong, to, call, this movie, un-american, courage and cowardice, are, universal emotions, the attitudes, of, the characters, in, high noon, are, i, think, incredibly truthful, telling, i know, that if, i, lived, in, the wild west, had, a job, family, was asked, to, stand, up, fight, against, a gang, of, gun-toting psychos, i would probably not be, able, to, do, it, is, why, gary cooper, will kane is such, a remarkable character, in, terms, of, self-respect, morality and inner strength, it, is, the way he, must uphold, the law, even, though, it, will, perhaps, cost, him his wife and his life, it, is, the various townfolk, with, most, of, us, will identify, even, if, it, makes, us, feel shame, unworthiness, to, admit, it, no matter, how, bravely, we, act, how, much we, want, to, think, heroically, of, ourselves, of, us, would cower, in, ...]",124.26354895783274,-19.063484453741992,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,1,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.752293577981652,218,274,john wayne totally wrong call movie un american courage cowardice universal emotions attitudes characters high noon think incredibly truthful telling know lived wild west job family asked stand fight gang gun toting psychos would probably able gary coopers kane remarkable character terms self respect morality inner strength way must uphold law even though perhaps cost wife life various townfolk us identify even makes us feel shame unworthiness admit matter bravely act much want think heroically 90 us would cower shadows time came kane movie wedding day dependable lawman kane gary cooper handed badge preparing leave town bride amy grace kelly receives devastating news old adversary frank miller ian macdonald pardoned crimes hanged way kanes town hadleyville revenge due noon train leaving kane hour either run life preparations fight kane amy set full gallop hoping put miles danger kane far feels compelled turn new sheriff due day let extraordinary sense duty responsibility feels towards town however gets town gets quite shock guts instances inclination fight alongside miller gang time ticks unstoppably towards noon kane gradually realises going stop miller boys going alone coopers performance extremely powerful received thoroughly deserved oscar kelly good bride although many viewers character hard like lloyd bridges brilliant early role kanes deputy best supporting pack katy jurado latino woman whose history men town puts unenviable position shooting starts fred zinnemann directs film outstandingly making scene fit grander scheme things literate precision aspiring young film maker wanting learn pace film correctly watch high noon close eye unparallelled perfectly paced film time music dmitri tomkin plus incredible ballad forsake oh darling tex ritter element makes high noon great masterpieces nothing else already film,0.27105639730639736,0.5675799663299662,1
High Noon (1952) - IMDb,"Like ""Shane"", ""High Noon"" is another Western that has ridden to film critic heaven on the back of Oscar victories. It's up to me to point out that the emperor has no clothes. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, just that it is overrated.Let me start with the positives:The movie is well paced. There is good tension. Most characters are well developed. It is well acted. Katy Kurtado, who has the only quality supporting role as a Mexican store owner/slut, has a great line where she tells Lloyd Bridges that Gary Cooper is better than him because ""Hees a mehn!"" Loved that.OK, I'm done with positives now.Here are the negatives:The basic plot doesn't make sense. This movie is often referred to as an example of an individual's steely resolve to stand up against wrong, even though abandoned by friends and society. But Kane runs like a rabbit as soon as he finds out the Millers are coming. It's only when he gets a couple of miles out of town that he realizes that he only has an hour head start on them. He tells his wife that they have no choice but to go back to town. ""They'll just catch us alone out in the open prairie,"" he says to Grace Kelly. ""My only chance is to stay in town and get help"".So, Kane did not stay out of principle. He stayed only because he had no other choice. Yet for the rest of the movie, Kane doesn't make that argument to the townspeople. In the final church scene, there are seven or eight men who are strongly inclined to support Kane. However, town elder Thomas Mitchell wants to avoid bad publicity and tells Kane the solution is for him to run.. Why doesn't he reply to Mitchell, ""You're telling me to commit suicide, it's too late to run. I need help now and you guys owe it to me"". Surely if he made that simple, compelling argument, his supporters would have come to his aid. Instead, he just glares at everyone and storms out.The Grace Kelly character makes absolutely no sense. How can she abandon her husband five minutes after she marries him because four guys want to kill him? He already told her that to leave town was virtual suicide. The age difference between Grace Kelly and Gary Cooper is disturbing and distracting. She looks like she's fifteen, he looks like her grandfather. Cooper was only 50 when they made this, but sadly, he was not a well man at this stage of this life. He looks closer to 60 in this movie.Kane's the hero of the story, but he's hard to admire. He seems too afraid of the bad guys. Also, he only prevails after his Quaker wife dry gulches Ben Miller. Critics wax poetic about this aspect of the movie, telling us that ""High Noon"" was the first ""anti-Western"", where the hero isn't brave. Fair enough, but I don't like anti-Westerns. I'm a Western fan. If I was anti-Western, I would watch musicals or romantic comedies, not ""High Noon"".The principal heavy is almost completely uncharacterized and is off screen for most of the movie. When he finally shows up, he looks like an accountant on vacation at a five star dude ranch. Only ""Butch Cassidy"" has a more poorly developed bad guy.What's so interesting about this movie being a metaphor for the HUAC investigation of communists in Hollywood? Who cares?And while we are on that subject, if this is movie such a liberal metaphor, what's with the tirades against weak courts releasing murderers? Isn't that a right wing rant? My head was spinning through this whole movie. ""Hounding Communists is bad and so is trial by jury.""This is a strictly back lot ""town"" Western. While movies with similar story lines obviously have few opportunities to film scenic backdrops, may directors find ways around this (George Stevens in ""Shane"", for example). This movie feels less like a real Western and more like a intellectual Broadway stage play with cowboy hats and spurs for props.There is not an iota of comic relief. I mean nada, niente, nothing. I read that Jack Elam's drunk had a comic scene deleted. Was this to keep the movie to its gimmicky ""real time"" length? If so, it wasn't worth it.Another plot hole. Mrs. Ramirez is so afraid of Frank Miller's vengeance upon her that she fire sales her business and skips town. She then proceeds to deliberately catch Miller's eye at the train station. He hardly seems to recognize her, much less attempt to punish her for her sins against him. Maybe Kane should have bought a train ticket too. It seems to provide full protection against ex-con gunslingers bent on revenge.And while we're on that subject, why would the Miller gang let Kane's wife waltz out of town on the train? Their many friends in town would surely point her out to them. Another reason Kane can't run. He has to stay to protect her, even though she's abandoned him for.....well, for staying to protect her? Like I said, the plot is irrational.The ending was much too abrupt. Another time saving measure?Finally, I'd like to know how the burning barn mysteriously extinguished itself. At the end all the townsfolk are crowding around the dead bodies, when they should have been scrambling to keep their homes from burning down.",doug-balch25,June/2010,4, Overrated Western,0,"[like,

Highlander: Endgame (2000) - IMDb,"After the ""Alien Experience"" and the ""Remake Sequel"", ""Highlander"" producers decided to add two and two and get someone to write a marvellous script. They went on with the mathematics, and got together Christopher Lambert and Adrian Paul. The result is the long-expected good sequel to the first ""Highlander"", set after ""The Series"" ended.Tired of the endless fights, Connor MacLeod enters the Sanctuary, a place where immortals can rest forever under the guard of the Watchers. However, an old foe of Connor releases him after killing all the other immortals in that place. Not pleased with this, this foe and his posse pays a visit to Duncan MacLeod, who gets away and looks for his clansman. Both MacLeods have sins to purge, and the time has come to do that.Christopher Lambert, though intended to have a supportive role like Sean Connery in the original film, robs the movie. Though his Connor is hardly the same bad ass of the other films, it's by far the best performance in the film. Adrian Paul manages to lead the film well, like in the TV series. Bruce Payne, playing the embittered Jacob Kell, provides a fine interpretation that is however in the line of the other ""Highlander"" villains. Lisa Barbuscia as Kate MacLeod is somewhat fine, but I'm inclined to believe the only reason ""Fishlips"" got cast is her willingness to show her breasts.The character of the film is indeed Jin Ke, played by Donnie Yen. However brief his presence on screen may be, he manages to give a very good impression, as well as some action. Another two characters worth mentioning are Rachel (the late Sheila Gish) and Heather (Beatie Edney), who appear again in a ""Highlander"" film. Briefly, but it's something.Why don't I give it a 10? First, the first film (which indeed deserves a 10) is superior to this one. Secondly, the editing of the film is weak. It's not the one of ""Highlander II: The Quickening"" but this one has some big flaws. In any case, ""Highlander Endgame"" is a great film, with more action and entertainment than the other sequels, and it's a great choice even for non fans.Seven!",carlos_b8417,August/2005,7, Finally a sequel,1,"[alien, experience, remake, sequel, highlander, producer, decide, add, two, two, get, someone, write, marvellous, script, go, mathematics, get, together, christopher, lambert, adrian, paul, result, good, sequel, first, highlander, set, series, endless, fight, connor, macleod, enters, sanctuary, place, immortal, rest, forever, guard, watcher, however, old, foe, connor, release, kill, immortal, place, pleased, foe, posse, pay, visit, duncan, macleod, get, away, look, clansman, macleod, sin, purge, time, come, lambert, though, intend, supportive, role, like, sean, connery, original, film, robs, movie, though, connor, hardly, bad, as, film, far, best, performance, film, adrian, paul, manages, lead, film, well, like, tv, series, bruce, payne, play, ...]","[after, alien experience, remake sequel, highlander, producers, decided, to, add, get, someone, to, write, a marvellous script, they, went, on with, the mathematics, got, together christopher lambert, adrian paul, the result, is, the long-expected good sequel, to, first, highlander, set, after, the series, ended.tired, of, the endless fights, connor macleod, enters, the sanctuary, a place, where, immortals, can rest, forever, under, the guard, of, the watchers, however, an old foe, of, connor releases him, after killing, all the other immortals, in that, place, not pleased, with, this foe, his posse, pays, a visit, to, duncan, macleod, gets, away, looks, for, his clansman, both macleods, have, sins, to, purge, the time, has come, to, do, that.christopher lambert, though, intended, to, have, a supportive role, like, sean connery, in, the original film, robs, the movie, though, his connor, is, hardly, the same bad ass, of, the other films, it, is, by, far, the best performance, in, ...]",16.281772585477608,-3.317879938751998,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,5.719178082191781,146,192,alien experience remake sequel highlander producers decided add someone write marvellous script went mathematics got together christopher lambert adrian paul result long expected good sequel first highlander set series ended tired endless fights connor macleod enters sanctuary place immortals rest forever guard watchers however old foe connor releases killing immortals place pleased foe posse pays visit duncan macleod gets away looks clansman macleods sins purge time christopher lambert though intended supportive role like sean connery original film robs movie though connor hardly bad ass films far best performance film adrian paul manages lead film well like tv series bruce payne playing embittered jacob kell provides fine interpretation however line highlander villains lisa barbuscia kate macleod somewhat fine inclined believe reason fishlips got cast willingness show breasts character film indeed jin ke played donnie yen however brief presence screen may manages give good impression well action another characters worth mentioning rachel late sheila gish heather beatie edney appear highlander film briefly something give 10 first first film indeed deserves 10 superior secondly editing film weak highlander ii quickening big flaws case highlander endgame great film action entertainment sequels great choice even non fans,0.1954301075268817,0.5099462365591398,1
Highlander: Endgame (2000) - IMDb,"About five minutes into ""Highlander: Endgame,"" the last film in the franchise which has given ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" a run for the money in the most ""unique"" fans, I realized that in the Highlander series, there are two separate universes that exist: The universe in which Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) became the final immortal and won the prize in 1986 (in the first film), and the one where, in the year 2000, the fight is still going on. In this universe, which was established in the TV series, Duncan MacLeod, Connor's younger brother (Adrian Paul) is the runner up for the prize, the major fight that took place in the first film was not the final battle between the last two immortals left, but merely one of many battles that were still to come.This film takes place in the latter series, and the final battle is at hand at long last, and it's down to two good immortals: Connor and Duncan, and an ancient, evil immortal (Bruce Payne) who has a posse of other immortals following him like he's some kind of anti-christ. He's also got a deadly agenda against Connor for something that took place in the past. It's cleverly written, so I dare not give anything away.""Endgame"" is a sequel to the first film as it took place in the TV series' universe, and a continuation of the TV show, which went off air some two years ago. In order to fully appretiate this film, the viewer needs to be familiar with both...and like them. Otherwise, he or she will get confused and bored. Make no mistake: It is a film by Highlander fans FOR Highlander fans, and little explanation is given for anything in this, because it assumes that anyone watching will be familiar with the premise and the rules of the immortal game upon entering the theater.As a serious film critic, I found the first film to be a masterpiece. Combining full-throttle thrills, an excellent premise, and top-rate performances, Highlander introduced us to the world of the immortals, and the premise was so thought-provoking that it drew the viewer in, and it made it easy for he or she to suspend their disbelief, if only for two hours. It deservedly joined the rank of ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" as one of the most successful and influential sci-fi films ever written. The second film didn't do so well, but the director's cut was definitely worth watching. ""The Final Dimension"" was a poor entry, and it was the last to take place in Connor's world, where he became the final immortal and took the prize.
With all of this said, as a fan of the first film, I can tell you that if you liked it, you will fall in love with ""Highlander: Endgame."" It's name implies that it is the final chapter, and it is, but not to the film series....no, this is the final chapter in the TV show, and it nicely caps the series. It is a most satisfactory wrap-up, with all the elements that made the first film and the TV show successful: Great camera-work, intruiging characters, flashbacks from all around the world, engaging conflicts, and some of the finest sword-fighting sequences that I have ever seen put to film. And the surprise ending in which one of the MacLeods makes the ultimate sacrifice will leave no fan with a dry eye (and if you are a fan who's seen it already, DON'T PANIC! Remember, this is not the same universe as that of the film series!).There are also some nice touches that only fans will enjoy: It was wonderful to see Heather, Connor's old wife, again, if only for a few brief moments. Watching the training sequences between Connor and Duncan are also well-written (and NOT  a rip off of the stuff seen between Connor and Ramirez in the first film). The different aspects of immortality that are explored are nothing short of ingenious, and the characters of both Connor and Duncan are very nicely developed. Joe and Methos's cameos from the TV show are also appretiated.If you're not a fan, walk away slowly with your hands raised in the air. If you like the series of films and the TV show, enjoy this gem which nicely seals the Highlander universe.

Highlander: The Final Dimension (1994) - IMDb,"Just to be up-front about this - I enjoy these films. The original - Highlander - was the only one in the series which really stands the test of time (Endgame has now joined it in this), and stands head and shoulders above the others for artistic merit and originality, but still, I liked the others well enough. I also like the much maligned Christopher Lambert. He's an odd actor to be sure - far from the Hollywood norm in appearance, style and accent, but he's nothing if not original and once you understand his understated style, you might just see that the guy has some serious talent. Read on if these statements resonate with you. Otherwise, feel free to move on without reading or rating this review.Lambert is good, Unger is good, Van Peebles is campy as hell, alternating between absurdist humor and menacing poseur-ship.The script is OK, certainly less grandiose and more mindless than II (and closer to the original in feeling, pace and plot), but not particularly original.The production values are a slight step up from II, about as good as Endgame, and almost up to the original's standards.Conor McLeod has reclaimed something of his humanity - imagining himself to be the last immortal on earth, but of course, he is wrong. Sorcerer Kane, who has stolen the magic of one of McLeod's former teachers, is hunting his head. McLeod has adopted a child and is about to fall in love again, the last thing he needs is an attack by an enemy who has no corporeal body.The film is entirely predictable, and is nothing more than a fan film.

Hot Fuzz (2007) - IMDb,"Hot Fuzz satirizes American action films in a way that an American satire would not. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg don't simply spoof the plot threads and the car chases. They know the smaller details of Hollywood's formula, as they exemplify with its continuous references to the scene in Point Break where Keanu Reeves fires his gun into the sky in anger and the scene in Bad Boys II where Martin Lawrence, in a circling tracking shot, says, ""S*** just got real."" Not only do they tackle those less clear characteristics of Hollywood, they also perfectly portray people who talk about awesome scenes in action movies, hilariously by Nick Frost. The film is brilliantly in precise tune with the American mainstream action adventure.The irony in this film is that it takes place in the serenely beautiful English countryside. In some ways, the film is very important for Americans to see. It delves very deeply into the conscious social mannerisms of the English, and parodies the timid insular English village life. Perhaps the most brilliant element of Hot Fuzz is the intertwining of a big-budget action film with gimmicks and a desperately fast pace and a quaint, atmospheric English village given the secrets-of-its-own flavor and a Agatha Christie-style expository structure.The film-making style in and of itself is complicit in the satire. The cinematography and editing is a product of the school of Tony Scott and Guy Ritchie. It's filled with jump cuts accompanied by loud and constantly changing sound effects, occasional strobe, and montages of grainy, bleached out, extravagantly lit shots edited together at machine gun speed. The soundtrack is that of any super-cool action film from Hollywood. This works so well not only as a dead-on impression of Hollywood film-making but also as a hilarious opposition to the English countryside.Simon Pegg's performance is a work of comic genius. His character is so well-developed as a man of invincible and authentic confidence and incredible drive, a workaholic, a zealot, and also an action hero stereotype. Nick Frost is a great second banana because not only is he the punchline to Pegg's straight line, he's also funny in such a direct, adolescent way, an unlikely comic relief sidekick.The film's great surprise is a comeback performance from Timothy Dalton. Not only is it a reappearance from the abyss he's been lost in since his two-year stint as James Bond, but also a vindication against all who've continually dismissed his credibility as an actor and doubted his comic ability. He's very funny and one of the film's great highlights.I've rarely seen a comedy so cleverly written, beautifully directed, atmospheric, or intelligently ridiculous.",jzappa30,April/2007,10, One of the Most Brilliant Comedies I've Ever Seen,1,"[hot, fuzz, satirizes, american, action, film, way, american, satire, would, edgar, wright, simon, pegg, simply, spoof, plot, thread, car, chase, know, small, detail, hollywood, formula, exemplify, continuous, reference, scene, point, break, keanu, reef, fire, gun, sky, anger, scene, bad, boy, ii, martin, lawrence, circle, track, shot, say, get, real, tackle, less, clear, characteristic, hollywood, also, perfectly, portray, people, talk, awesome, scene, action, movie, hilariously, nick, frost, film, brilliantly, precise, tune, american, mainstream, action, irony, film, take, place, serenely, beautiful, english, countryside, way, film, important, american, see, delf, deeply, conscious, social, mannerism, english, parody, timid, insular, english, village, life, perhaps, brilliant, ...]","[hot fuzz, satirizes, american action films, in, a way, that, an american satire, would, not, edgar wright and simon pegg, do, not simply, spoof, the plot threads, the car chases, they, know, the smaller details, of, hollywood, formula, as, they, exemplify, with, its continuous references, to, the scene, in, point break, where, keanu reeves fires his gun, into, the sky, in, anger and the scene, in, bad boys, ii, where, martin lawrence, in, circling tracking, shot, says, s, just got, real, not only do, they, tackle, those less clear characteristics, of, hollywood, they, also perfectly portray, people, talk, about, awesome scenes, in, action movies, hilariously, by, nick frost, the film, is, brilliantly, in, precise tune, with, the american mainstream action, adventure.the irony, in, this film, is, that, it, takes, place, in, the serenely beautiful english countryside, in, some ways, the film, is, very important, for, americans, to, see, it, delves, very deeply, into, the conscious social mannerisms, of, the english, parodies, the timid insular english village life, ...]",91.86062454598564,-15.066804939530304,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,1,1,4,0,5,5,4,6.492385786802031,197,249,hot fuzz satirizes american action films way american satire would edgar wright simon pegg simply spoof plot threads car chases know smaller details hollywoods formula exemplify continuous references scene point break keanu reeves fires gun sky anger scene bad boys ii martin lawrence circling tracking shot says got real tackle less clear characteristics hollywood perfectly portray people talk awesome scenes action movies hilariously nick frost film brilliantly precise tune american mainstream action adventure irony film takes place serenely beautiful english countryside ways film important americans delves deeply conscious social mannerisms english parodies timid insular english village life perhaps brilliant element hot fuzz intertwining big budget action film gimmicks desperately fast pace quaint atmospheric english village given secrets flavor agatha christie style expository structure film making style complicit satire cinematography editing product school tony scott guy ritchie filled jump cuts accompanied loud constantly changing sound effects occasional strobe montages grainy bleached extravagantly lit shots edited together machine gun speed soundtrack super cool action film hollywood works well dead impression hollywood film making hilarious opposition english countryside simon peggs performance work comic genius character well developed man invincible authentic confidence incredible drive workaholic zealot action hero stereotype nick frost great second banana punchline peggs straight line funny direct adolescent way unlikely comic relief sidekick films great surprise comeback performance timothy dalton reappearance abyss lost since year stint james bond vindication continually dismissed credibility actor doubted comic ability funny films great highlights rarely seen comedy cleverly written beautifully directed atmospheric intelligently ridiculous,0.2020833333333333,0.47955729166666655,1

Hot Pursuit (2015) - IMDb,"I had low expectations going into this and even then I was shocked at how offensively unfunny this movie is. I can forgive a movie when it tries to do something inventive or experimental and falls flat, but Hot Pursuit is the most cookie-cutter ""buddy"" comedy you can imagine, using cheap gags that have been done a hundred times before and two talented leads that cannot save this abomination of a movie no matter how hard they try.Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara are talented and funny when given the opportunity. Hot Pursuit however goes out of its way to make them as unlikable, unfunny, and downright annoying as possible. Witherspoon uses a terrible Southern accent the whole movie, which is weird because she used a similar accent 20 years ago (Freeway) and it sounded perfectly fine. Vergara's accent is hard enough to understand but it's amped up to 100 here making half her lines indecipherable. There are moments where you can tell the two actresses are having fun, but the material is so lazy that none of it comes across in the actual dialogue. In fact the most enjoyable banter between them is during the outtakes where they're not obligated to follow the horrendous script.I can nitpick this movie to death but what's the point. Watch the trailers - if it looks funny to you then you'll probably get a kick out of it. If not, avoid this like the plague.

House of Flying Daggers (2004) - IMDb,"After absolutely loving 'Hero', I couldn't wait for Zhang Yimou's latest Wuxia Pien feature to arrive on DVD. After watching it, I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed, as it is another sumptuous, stylistic feature, which deserves all the accolades it is likely to receive.The plot of the film is told in a more linear narrative when compared to that of 'Hero', but that is not to say it is any more straightforward. Set in the Tang Dynasty, the basic premise is nothing to write home about, featuring government officials on the trail of an underground rebel alliance 'The House of Flying Daggers'. However, there is enough characterisation and depth to hold your attention, while the (sometimes predictable) plot twists keep you guessing. Unfortunately, there is nothing entirely new about this story and it's probably familiar ground to fans of the wuxia genre. Nevertheless, it flows at a decent pace and is punctuated with enough stylistic action sequences that the 2-hour running time is quickly exhausted.As with Yimou's impressive previous feature, Tony Ching Siu-tung takes over the action direction, producing another sterling performance. In my opinion, he is currently the top fight choreographer around after spending so many years being considered second fiddle to the likes of Yuen Wo-ping and Sammo Hung; he now deserves to be considered above them on his current output. In this instance, much of the overt stylisation evident in Hero is played down in favour of more grounded, natural martial artistry. There is still plenty of wire work and a spattering of CGI to aid the sequences, however, it is plain to see that much of the action displayed is a mix of genuine swordplay and actual technique. All the performers acquit themselves well considering none of them are formally trained in martial arts  especially Zhang Ziyi who performs impressively from start to finish.As you would expect from a Zhang Yimou film, the visuals are majestic, with primary colours and panoramic landscapes making up much of what we see. Unfortunately, many people do not seem to take to this artistic approach, and will label the film another case of style over substance. I would disagree, as I believe it contains plenty of both with a strong cast, interesting characters and high quality action to provide the foundation for the kind of bold, sumptuous visuals, which are rare to find in modern film.Overall, I personally prefer 'Hero' but know of plenty who would disagree. As a result, I recommend it as a definite purchase to any fan of films from this genre.",tpr00720,November/2004,9, Following on from HERO with another visually arresting feature...,1,"[absolutely, love, could, wait, zhang, yimou, late, wuxia, pien, feature, arrive, dvd, watch, happy, say, disappoint, another, sumptuous, stylistic, feature, deserves, accolade, likely, plot, film, told, linear, narrative, compare, say, straightforward, set, tang, dynasty, basic, premise, nothing, write, home, feature, government, official, trail, underground, rebel, alliance, house, fly, dagger, however, enough, characterisation, depth, hold, attention, sometimes, predictable, plot, twist, keep, guess, unfortunately, nothing, entirely, new, story, probably, familiar, ground, fan, wuxia, genre, nevertheless, flow, decent, pace, punctuate, enough, stylistic, action, sequence, run, time, quickly, yimou, impressive, previous, feature, tony, ching, take, action, direction, produce, another, sterling, performance, opinion, currently, top, ...]","[after, absolutely, loving, hero, i, could not wait, for, zhang yimou, latest wuxia, pien, feature, to, arrive, on, dvd, after, watching, it, i, am, happy, to, say, i, was not disappointed, as, it, is, another sumptuous, stylistic feature, deserves, all the accolades it, is, likely, to, receive.the, plot, of, the film, is told, in, a more linear narrative, when, compared, to that of, hero, is, not, to, say, it, is, more straightforward, set, in, the tang dynasty, the basic premise, is nothing, to, write, home, about, featuring, government officials, on, the trail, of, an underground rebel alliance, ', the house, of, flying, daggers, however, is, enough characterisation, depth, to, hold, your attention, while, sometimes predictable, plot twists, keep, you, guessing, unfortunately, is nothing, entirely new, about, this story, it, is, probably familiar ground, to, fans, of, the wuxia genre, nevertheless, it, ...]",75.46750747748388,-17.360964301295738,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,3,1,4,0,5,5,4,6.310526315789473,190,234,absolutely loving hero could wait zhang yimous latest wuxia pien feature arrive dvd watching happy disappointed another sumptuous stylistic feature deserves accolades likely receive plot film told linear narrative compared hero straightforward set tang dynasty basic premise nothing write home featuring government officials trail underground rebel alliance house flying daggers however enough characterisation depth hold attention sometimes predictable plot twists keep guessing unfortunately nothing entirely new story probably familiar ground fans wuxia genre nevertheless flows decent pace punctuated enough stylistic action sequences 2 hour running time quickly exhausted yimous impressive previous feature tony ching siu tung takes action direction producing another sterling performance opinion currently top fight choreographer around spending many years considered second fiddle likes yuen wo ping sammo hung deserves considered current output instance much overt stylisation evident hero played favour grounded natural martial artistry still plenty wire work spattering cgi aid sequences however plain much action displayed mix genuine swordplay actual technique performers acquit well considering none formally trained martial arts  especially zhang ziyi performs impressively start finish would expect zhang yimou film visuals majestic primary colours panoramic landscapes making much unfortunately many people seem take artistic approach label film another case style substance would disagree believe contains plenty strong cast interesting characters high quality action provide foundation kind bold sumptuous visuals rare modern film overall personally prefer hero know plenty would disagree result recommend definite purchase fan films genre,0.18400162337662337,0.5007296176046175,1
House of Flying Daggers (2004) - IMDb,"Normally, I am a pretty generous critic, but in the case of this film I have to say it was incredibly bad. I am stunned by how positive most reviews seem to be.There were some gorgeous shots, but it's too bad they were wasted on this sinkhole of a movie. It might have worked if ""Daggers"" was purely an action flick and not a romance, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between either of the couples, whatever exists between Mei and her men seems to be more lust than love, and for the most part the dialogue is just silly. This may be just a problem with translation, but the frequent usage of the word ""flirt"" in particular reminded me of 8th grade, not head-over-heels, together forever, worth-dying-for love; I also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor. The audience is given very little about the characters to really care about, and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole. I was wishing for a remote control to fast forward, I was slumped in my seat ready to snore, but mostly I just cringed a lot.*******spoiler*****Now, the icing on the cake. Or rather, adding insult to injury. The ending was truly one of the most horrible, laughable ones I have ever seen. The boys are having their stag fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other. Oh, and then it starts to snow. Randomly. Oh, and then Mei (dagger embedded in heart) suddenly pops up out of the weeds. Then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach it's destination, even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet. Wow, cool.Well, then Mei dies finally I guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death. Jin sings, sobs, holds her body close, screen goes blank.

How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014) - IMDb,"I picked up my future wife for a simple dinner and a movie date. We hadn't picked out a movie yet as we had decided to choose at the theater. Upon arriving, we saw that How To Train Your Dragon 2 was selling it's 8:00-10:00 Thursday night showings. I'd completely forgotten it was coming out Friday, so both of us, ecstatic, decided on that movie. I went in expecting a great film. I came out blown away. I can honestly say I've never seen a sequel better than it's predecessor, but How To Train Your Dragon 2 does nothing but improve and top the first one. The music was the best I've heard in a very long time. The story introduced so many things that was simply another piece of master storytelling. The relationships in the movie, especially Toothless' and Hiccup's, were written to their absolute strongest. After all the films I've seen, all the shows I've watched, all the books I've read, I have never come across a friendship stronger than Hiccup's and Toothless'. The way they write that relationship is just . . . it's never been done before. The story itself is actually pretty simple and actually a really short story, but it's a story you could tell the writer fell in love with. And he brought this story to the best it can absolutely be. The villain was chilling, the characters' outcomes were emotional, and the climax will completely shake your soul. I have no complaints. No complaints at all.

How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014) - IMDb,"Finally being able to watch this movie, I was stoked! I loved the first film, and it was about time to watch another light-hearted but intelligent movie about dragons and vikings in a universe I quickly learned to love. What a bummer.The subtle humor and cuteness of the first movie has been utterly demolished by slapstick that would put early Monty Python to shame and repeated gags that weren't funny to begin with. Oddly timed jokes seemingly thrown out at random took the edge off of a lot of situations that actually needed to be played out to the fullest.Now, one thing I loved about the first movie was the balance between mature themes, expertly crafted into a believable story that both kids and adults could enjoy. The absence of a classical villain - instead leaving misunderstanding and fear as the culprits - gave it an edge and a message I don't recall seeing in any other animated movie. Sadly, it's sequel seems to completely ignore the success of this formula, and tackles huge and serious situations such as abandonment of one's family, the death of a loved one by the hand of a loved one, and treason in a manner that leaves me in wanting of other plot devices it can actually sustain as a movie primarily targeted towards children. The villain seems utterly forced, and lacks any credibility whatsoever. I never once truly believed that a raving monkey-man like that managed to subdue and bend the will of powers that were far superior to him. His motives are ridiculous, his back-story (which he apparently tells anybody that crosses his path in an instant) is as thin as a single sheet of toilet paper, and his personal integrity and conviction just makes him seem like something they just threw in there on a whim.I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but I just couldn't! I couldn't force myself to believe the family reunion and how lightly everybody took it. I couldn't believe the villain. Frankly, I could hardly believe anything! That's not to say the movie is entirely void of anything enjoyable. I like the way they keep fleshing out our main protagonist and his entourage - particularly his relationship to shield maiden Astrid. I just wish the rest of the movie would be approached with the same thought through storytelling.As much as I'd love to love it, I must sadly go back and re-watch both the first one and this once again. It might have been my mood when I watched it, or it might be another case of ""The Dark Knight Rises-"" a movie I found so utterly horrendous and pointless it still makes me angry to think of the great reviews it received.

How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World (2019) - IMDb,"Almost nine years we have waited for this dramatic conclusion. Was it worth it? Definitely!There are moments when watching this film that I thought that it was getting a little slow paced for me. However at the conclusion, I had come to appreciate every scene knowing that those scenes contributed greatly to the emotional ending.The movie itself continues with the journey of Hiccup and Toothless. Hiccup is now chief but his focus is divided between looking after his people and the saving of dragons that are still threatened by humans outside of Berk. Hiccup embarks on a quest to find ""The Hidden World"", however he only has stories and few notes passed on from his father to go by. He believes that moving all dragons and his people to this mystical location will be the safest bet for their survival, given that Hiccup has made Berk an enemy of many tribes by raiding and saving dragons from those that do not mean well.As expected there is a new villain in this film by the name of Grimmel the Grisly. On a Villain meter this guy gets a solid 10. Cunning, ruthless, and hunter of dragons for the pure joy of it.As Toothless meets a new mate, Hiccup is faced with one of the hardest decisions of his life. However is it one that he is willing to make?How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is nothing short of a work of art. Is it the best movie in the series? I would say that it is on par with the others as each film captures the growth of Hiccup and the bond between himself and Toothless in a particular point in time. However I can say that this film is easily the most emotional.The supporting characters all play pivotal roles as Hiccup has grown to trust and rely on his dear friends over the course of the three films.This movie is great for all ages. Dreamworks have done a wonderful job in creating a timeless classic.

Yes it is, and yes it does.But this isn't a Hollywood slasher flick. The kills in this movie are not gratifying and aren't meant to be. The women being killed are not scantily clad models running through forests from men wearing masks. There is nothing pleasant or ""cool"" about these scenes; they make the viewer uncomfortable, they unsettle, they bring one's mind into very dark places. It gives us a peek into the madness that every man is capable of, and does so realistically and without pulling its punches. This brutal realism makes people uncomfortable, and prompts negative reviews. This is understandable, but unfortunate. I believe that a movie should be judged on more than the amount of blood the viewer is comfortable seeing on-screen. To these people, please, do not watch Korean revenge thrillers if you are uncomfortable with torture or blood.But enough of that rambling. This movie is excellent. Beautiful cinematography contrasts the stark, dimly lit scenes where the murders, or gritty fight scenes, occur. The camera work is simple but effective; the viewer is often treated to close-ups of both Byung-hun Lee and Mik-sik Choi, and their facial expressions tell us more than dialogue ever could. There is also contrast between Lee and Choi. Lee, clean and stoic, and Choi, filthy and madly expressive. They compliment each other very well, and play off of each others strengths effectively.The story itself is typical of revenge films, but fantastic in its execution. Lee's character experiences a profound loss at the hands of Choi's character, and in the process of seeking revenge begins to resemble the man he so hates. The line between ""victim"" and ""aggressor"" becomes blurred between both characters. This is where the film shines. There is no black and white in ""I Saw the Devil""; the viewer is left with shades of grey.As for the acting, it was all done very well. As I mentioned, Lee and Choi work well together, and all supporting cast members did an excellent job. Choi portrays his character in an incredibly convincing manner, shifting suddenly from calmness to manic anger, but never in a way that feels unnatural or forced. Lee's character is quiet and much less expressive, but he does very well in showing immense amounts of emotion through just his eyes or subtle movements of his body. A memorable performance from them both.As for flaws, the only thing I can think of is the strange, perhaps unrealistic behaviour of the police. Lee is a member of the NIS, and is very skilled when it comes to remaining hidden, but that shouldn't make him untouchable when directly provoking police officers or driving on the wrong side of the street. Still, though, it's a very trivial complaint that isn't worth a deducted point.A confident 10/10 from me. If you are comfortable seeing serial murder portrayed realistically, and are able to appreciate more than just gore, please, do yourself a favour and watch this film.",inkgrenade18,November/2010,10, Haunting but beautiful.,1,"[whenever, see, negative, review, saw, devil, critic, always, mention, scornfully, movie, ultra, violent, portrays, woman, horrify, circumstance, yes, yes, hollywood, slasher, flick, kill, movie, gratify, meant, woman, kill, scantily, clad, model, run, forest, men, wear, mask, nothing, pleasant, cool, scene, make, viewer, uncomfortable, unsettle, bring, one, mind, dark, place, give, u, peek, madness, every, man, capable, realistically, without, pull, punch, brutal, realism, make, people, uncomfortable, prompt, negative, review, understandable, unfortunate, believe, movie, judged, amount, blood, viewer, comfortable, see, people, please, watch, korean, revenge, thriller, uncomfortable, torture, enough, ramble, movie, excellent, beautiful, cinematography, contrast, stark, dimly, lit, scene, murder, gritty, fight, ...]","[whenever, i see a negative review, of, i, saw, the devil, the critic, always mentions, scornfully, that, the movie, is, ultra violent, portrays, women, in, horrifying circumstances, it, is, it, does.but, is, not, a hollywood slasher flick, the kills, in, this movie, are, not gratifying, are not meant, to, be, the women, being killed are not scantily clad, models, running, through, forests, from, men, wearing, masks, is nothing, pleasant, cool, about, these scenes, they, make, the viewer, uncomfortable, they, unsettle, they, bring, mind, into, very dark places, it, gives, us a peek, into, the madness, that, every man, is, capable, of, does, so realistically, without, pulling, its punches, this brutal realism, makes, people, uncomfortable, prompts, negative reviews, is, understandable, unfortunate, i, believe, that, a movie, should be judged, on, more, than, the amount, of, blood, the viewer, is, comfortable seeing, on-screen, to, these people, please, ...]",117.64178684774258,-16.21123196401798,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,1,1,4,0,5,5,4,6.061320754716982,212,270,whenever negative review saw devil critic always mentions scornfully movie ultra violent portrays women horrifying circumstances yes yes hollywood slasher flick kills movie gratifying meant women killed scantily clad models running forests men wearing masks nothing pleasant cool scenes viewer uncomfortable unsettle bring ones mind dark places gives us peek madness every man capable realistically without pulling punches brutal realism makes people uncomfortable prompts negative reviews understandable unfortunate believe movie judged amount blood viewer comfortable seeing screen people please watch korean revenge thrillers uncomfortable torture blood enough rambling movie excellent beautiful cinematography contrasts stark dimly lit scenes murders gritty fight scenes occur camera work simple effective viewer often treated close ups byung hun lee mik sik choi facial expressions us dialogue ever could contrast lee choi lee clean stoic choi filthy madly expressive compliment well play others strengths effectively story typical revenge films fantastic execution lees character experiences profound loss hands chois character process seeking revenge begins resemble man hates line victim aggressor becomes blurred characters film shines black white saw devil viewer left shades grey acting done well mentioned lee choi work well together supporting cast members excellent job choi portrays character incredibly convincing manner shifting suddenly calmness manic anger never way feels unnatural forced lees character quiet much less expressive well showing immense amounts emotion eyes subtle movements body memorable performance flaws thing think strange perhaps unrealistic behaviour police lee member nis skilled comes remaining hidden untouchable directly provoking police officers driving wrong side street still though trivial complaint worth deducted point confident 10 10 comfortable seeing serial murder portrayed realistically able appreciate gore please favour watch film,0.030555555555555565,0.598313492063492,1
I Saw the Devil (2010) - IMDb,"Many reviewers who give this movie a good rating assume that most critics are put off by the violence and the bloodshed and then proceed to support their appreciation for the movie by explaining that one needs to look through the (apparently necessary) gore and appreciate the deeper layers of the movie. Well, I wasn't necessarily put off by the gore, although I don't appreciate gore for the sake of gore (I don't like the Saw movies). I think Old Boy was an excellent movie for example. That movie went far beyond violence and gore and covered themes like pain, loss and revenge in a wildly original, meaningful way. 'I saw the devil' attempts to do something similar (at least, that is what I assume), but it fails miserably. The acting is actually quite good, Min-Sik Choi and Byung-Hun Lee are very capable actors, without any doubt. And the story starts off very promising. There's a good build up the first 45 minutes, but after that the story unravels into an inconsistent mess within no time. I deduct that the supposed moral of the story is that revenge cannot heal the inflicted pain, even if you try to live out your revenge in installments. And that in the end revenge backfires and the moral borderline between victim and perpetrator starts to dissolve. Fair enough, I've seen less illuminated morals in movies. But the execution of the idea undermines the whole purpose. A couple of examples: GPS-capsules are solid poop-proof and only flush out with diarrhea? And exactly at what level of mushiness does the capsule decide to go for the exit? These may seem like trivial questions, but are essential to the story development. And mind you, Kimchi tends to be pretty spicy. The first time the serial killer is set loose (temporarily) he happens to catch a ride with two killers (with a dead body in the trunk) - oh, what a coincidence. And of course he kills them, in a moving car. The secret agent discovers the 3 bodies, but somehow this does not convince him that his gamble to keep the serial killer on the loose may harm innocent bystanders (or are we supposed to believe that he knew they were killers and that justice was somehow done, despite the fact that he should know that the killer doesn't just have an appetite for 'guilty' victims as he butchered his fiancée). Many more people end up dead or traumatized because of this gamble. And don't tell me that his hatred and urge for revenge have already completely taken over his rationality and morality at that point - why then proceed 1,5 hours to portray this disintegration? The other cops are supposedly completely incapable and do nothing to stop the carnage. Our cop gone rogue uses his cell phone a number of times to call with the police but they have no way to track him down? Despite the fact that they have GPS capsules with microphones in their arsenal they cannot track down a mobile phone? And even when they meet him at his father in law's house they don't apprehend him? Moreover, when the serial killer decides to surrender to the police, about 50 cops are waiting at the agreed meeting point. Then, our rogue cop comes driving by and while driving pulls the serial killer (waving a knife) into the car and abducts him. And the other cops just stand by, doing nothing. What? All 50 cops came on bicycle or using public transport and cannot pursue a driver who is struggling to subdue a serial killer with a knife while driving? And so on, and so onI'm willing to accept a (tiny) bit of illogicality, coincidence, inconsistency and even plain stupidity in a movie, but a movie should not be build on that. At least, that is my humble opinion.

"I, Frankenstein (2014) - IMDb","I must admit that I enjoyed watching this supernatural action flick heavy on CGI effects despite its flaws. I wondered why afterwards. First, it seemed to follow from the book events and made a good point that the creature is not actually called Frankenstein. However, the ""creature"" itself, played by a strong Aaron Eckhart (Harvey Dent in Dark Knight) did not look like any previous incarnation. Mostly, it looked like a normal-sized, muscular, even handsome man with scars, not like a tall, grotesque, patchwork of a man as it should have been. So, the film following this trend of making ""monsters"" sexy bugged me, but the performance of Eckhart won me over. He might not have emoted much, as befitted the character who didn't learn how, but he certainly had the charisma and gravitas necessary. He didn't look the part but he acted the haunted, grim part very well.So, the story starts not long after the end of the Frankenstein book by Mary Shelley at the end of the 18th century (1795). While burying his creator, Frankenstein, he find himself attacked by ""evil"" demons (who look like men, but with demonic faces sometimes) and rescued by, of all things, ""good"" gargoyles (who look human except when they're CGI gargoyles). The creature is brought to the gargoyle leader and quickly given a name, Adam. He's made an offer to join them in a secret war against the demons over humanity's fate. He declines and lives the next 200 years alone (would have been nice to see, but glossed over in a few minutes), defending against demons. Cue modern day, where his presence is revealed once more to the demons who are trying to bring back life to dead bodies for their own purposes.So, instead of the overbooked vampires and werewolves, we have demons against gargoyles, plus Frankenstein's creature thrown in to act as wild card. I, for one, found that refreshing. However, the demons looked and acted like standard evil vampires, except when you saw their red eyes or their faces reverting to demonic. Except for their sophisticated leader, they were quite underwhelming and even boring from lack of personality. The gargoyles fared a little better, switching from medieval-looking, grey-tunic-wearing human warriors to big, winged stone gargoyles like you see on some old churches. They were supposed to be good (angels in disguise), but I liked their ambiguity. I didn't initially care for their obvious CGI looks, but they eventually grew on me, and who knows what animated gargoyles might look like anyway.Foremost, this is an action flick, not really drama or horror, so it doesn't delve much on the inner psychological turmoils of Adam or his everyday ""normal"" life, nor does it try to scare or gross you out. However, the somber, tormented portrayal by Aaron Eckhart (mostly with his face and eyes) made him an interesting anti-hero. The action itself was peculiar. There were cool set pieces where tons of demons fought gargoyles around a very impressive-looking Gothic church. It had an epic feel to it, it was quite exciting, but you seemed distanced from the action because it cut things fast and the camera often pulled back. Also, there was a particular vibe as the numerous, weak demons were mostly slaughtered by the fewer, powerful flying gargoyles. It was usually one blow, one kill. On the other hand, you had one-on-one fights involving Adam that were very good for the most part. There were still quick cuts, but it wasn't abusive, sometimes lingering a bit on an angle, making for more involving and easier-to-follow battles. The musical soundtrack was better than expected with epic-sounding classical music and dramatic choruses.Storywise, I found the concept interesting, the demons' motivation made sense, and it didn't hinder my enjoyment with too much obvious stupidity, except a few places where I thought things were just too convenient (like no civilians in the streets or the ""secret"" base of the demons being so close to the church of the gargoyles). The dialogue seemed awkward or cliché at times, but it was said with such sincerity that it passed through anyway except for a few chuckles from the audience. I liked watching the film, but I don't think I would have wanted to pay full price for it in theatres though. It was like a summer blockbuster but in the middle of the winter.Rating: 6.5 out of 10 (Good)",Quebec_Dragon24,January/2014,6, I... didn't find it so bad.,1,"[must, admit, enjoy, watch, supernatural, action, flick, heavy, cgi, effect, despite, flaw, wonder, afterwards, first, seem, follow, book, event, make, good, point, creature, actually, call, frankenstein, however, creature, played, strong, aaron, eckhart, harvey, dent, dark, knight, look, like, previous, incarnation, mostly, look, like, muscular, even, handsome, man, scar, like, tall, grotesque, patchwork, man, film, follow, trend, make, monster, sexy, bug, performance, eckhart, might, emote, much, befit, character, learn, certainly, charisma, gravitas, necessary, look, part, act, haunt, grim, part, story, start, long, end, frankenstein, book, mary, shelley, end, century, bury, creator, frankenstein, find, attack, evil, demon, look, like, men, demonic, face, ...]","[i, must admit, that, i, enjoyed watching, this supernatural action flick, heavy, on, cgi effects, despite, its flaws, i, wondered, why afterwards, first, it, seemed, to, follow, from, the book events, made, a good point, that, the creature, is not actually called, frankenstein, however, creature, itself, played, by, a strong aaron eckhart, harvey dent, in, dark knight, did not look, like, any previous incarnation, mostly, it, looked, like, a normal-sized, muscular, even handsome man, with, scars, not, like, a tall, grotesque, patchwork, of, a man, as, it, should have been, so, the film, following, this trend, of, making, monsters, sexy bugged, me, the performance, of, eckhart, won, me, over, he, might not have emoted, much, as, befitted, the character, did not learn, how, he, certainly had, the charisma, gravitas, necessary, he, did not look, the part, he, acted, haunted, grim part, very, the story, starts, not long, after, the end, of, ...]",253.98014736915547,-4.0104049490327265,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,1,2,1,4,2,3,1,0,1,2,0,5.786231884057972,276,391,must admit enjoyed watching supernatural action flick heavy cgi effects despite flaws wondered afterwards first seemed follow book events made good point creature actually called frankenstein however creature played strong aaron eckhart harvey dent dark knight look like previous incarnation mostly looked like normal sized muscular even handsome man scars like tall grotesque patchwork man film following trend making monsters sexy bugged performance eckhart might emoted much befitted character learn certainly charisma gravitas necessary look part acted haunted grim part well story starts long end frankenstein book mary shelley end 18th century 1795 burying creator frankenstein attacked evil demons look like men demonic faces sometimes rescued things good gargoyles look human except cgi gargoyles creature brought gargoyle leader quickly given name adam made offer secret war demons humanitys fate declines lives next 200 years alone would nice glossed minutes defending demons cue modern day presence revealed demons trying bring life dead bodies purposes instead overbooked vampires werewolves demons gargoyles plus frankensteins creature thrown act wild card found refreshing however demons looked acted like standard evil vampires except saw red eyes faces reverting demonic except sophisticated leader quite underwhelming even boring lack personality gargoyles fared little better switching medieval looking grey tunic wearing human warriors big winged stone gargoyles like old churches supposed good angels disguise liked ambiguity initially care obvious cgi looks eventually grew knows animated gargoyles might look like anyway foremost action flick really drama horror delve much inner psychological turmoils adam everyday normal life scare gross however somber tormented portrayal aaron eckhart mostly face eyes made interesting anti hero action peculiar cool set pieces tons demons fought gargoyles around impressive looking gothic church epic feel quite exciting seemed distanced action cut things fast camera often pulled particular vibe numerous weak demons mostly slaughtered fewer powerful flying gargoyles usually blow kill hand fights involving adam good part still quick cuts abusive sometimes lingering bit angle making involving easier follow battles musical soundtrack better expected epic sounding classical music dramatic choruses storywise found concept interesting demons motivation made sense hinder enjoyment much obvious stupidity except places thought things convenient like civilians streets secret base demons close church gargoyles dialogue seemed awkward cliché times said sincerity passed anyway except chuckles audience liked watching film think would wanted pay full price theatres though like summer blockbuster middle winter rating 6 5 10 good,0.08733089826839825,0.49257305194805207,1
"I, Frankenstein (2014) - IMDb","To say that ""I, Frankentein"" was a waste of time would be an understatement. Much like ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters,"" ""I, Frankenstein tries to re-invent a classic tale for the action audience with little success. Though to be fair, ""Witch Hunters"" at least had some moments of memorable silliness and creative set pieces. ""I, Frankenstein"" has neither, nor does it present its audience with decent writing or memorable thrills.The plot itself is a mangled-up mess and a failed attempt to re-invent Mary Shelly's classic character. In this film, Frankenstein's monster (played by the seemingly disinterested Aaron Eckhart) somehow gets involved in an ongoing battle with demons and gargoyles after the events of the classic story. Everything from his backstory to the motivations of the demons and gargoyles is told in rushed exposition and gives absolutely no time for the audience to care about any of the characters. It doesn't help that the editing and pacing is extremely choppy, often skipping hours and years into the future with no reasonable transition. In the span of what feels like five minutes, the film tells Frankenstein's backstory, introduces the demons and gargoyles, explains their ongoing war, shows a training montage of Frankenstein learning to use the gargoyle's weapons, and suddenly cuts from the 18th century to present day. Nearly all of this is done in cheap narrated exposition and it kills the possibility of the audience getting attached to the characters.Now, I'm sure many people can overlook a lackluster script if a movie has ""good action."" Unfortunately, this movie fails in this department too. All of the fight scenes are bland and dull with redundant, badly executed CGI. Perhaps the most frustrating example of this is that every time a demon is killed on screen, it turns into a swirling fireball. This effect looked cool for about a minute and it quickly got stale, especially when the demons are dying left and right and the effects start to look like they've been copied and pasted. The PG-13 rating also takes away the possibility of even a little gore to entertain the horror buffs. This is especially a shame because there are some very sleek and polished weapon designs that look like they could have been used for some good ole hack-and-slash fun.Little effort seems to have been put into this film, and even a big-time star like Aaron Eckhart can't elevate the material. Here he seems dazed and bored, almost as if this film was just a project to waste some time. In fact, none of the actors seem interested, and with the exception of maybe two awkward line readings, there is nothing to laugh at either.Like many films released in January, ""I, Frankenstein,"" comes across as filler and it is not even worth a view on Netflix streaming. Between the poor script, the dull characters and the bad effects, there is next to nothing here worth enjoying.

Inception (2010) - IMDb,"I'd like to keep my review rather to the point.Pros: 1. its theme - dream is a fascinating topic to say the least. There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. 2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. 3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does.4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it's hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. 5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe. 6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.Cons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me. 2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused. 3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid, Inception overused this trick. In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement.

Inception (2010) - IMDb,"The central idea of ""Inception"" is an interesting one: technology exists to enter other people's dreams in order to steal their most private secrets or to implant new ideas. With Christopher Nolan of ""Memento"" fame as writer and director, this should have been a smart, compelling movie. Unfortunately, ""Inception"" is a bloated failure.The root problem is that Nolan replaces the fascinating surrealism of dream worlds with lengthy outtakes from James Bond movies. For example, early in the film, when Cobb and Ariadne are sitting at a café in a dream world, Cobb tells Ariadne to stay calm. What's going to happen? Is the waiter going to bring her a glass full of wriggling eyeballs? Is she going to turn around and see her best friend from high school having sex with Abraham Lincoln? No. THINGS START EXPLODING. And that's the whole movie in a nutshell: gaudy special effects and endless fight scenes as a poor substitute for imaginative ideas.The matryoshka-doll plot of dreams within dreams isn't nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine. This is largely because nothing of consequence happens at higher levels once our heroes have moved on to deeper levels. The higher-level supporting actors just fight off bad guys -- and overblown special effects -- until it's time to bring back their colleagues from the depths.Nolan should sit back, watch a few of the best movies by Luis Bunuel and David Lynch, and try again with one-tenth the budget and ten times the imagination.

Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) - IMDb,"This adventure flick, which mixes the Western movie formula and special effects in their infant days, represents the American mainstream cinema in the early 80s in many ways. The protagonist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a scholar and an action hero; this combination is unique but the uniqueness has nothing to do with the character development and seems to be the result of the filmmakers' thoughtless decision. The portrayal of the heroine Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) is also inconsistent; sometimes she is tough and independent, while frail and dependent on Indiana Jones in the other times. Along with a dragging optimistic story, overly stretched action scenes may be beyond the audience's attention span. The Reaganomix overshadows the plot, where the Americans can do whatever they want in foreign places (South America, Nepal, and Cairo). The sets of Nepal and Cairo look nothing but sets, while John Williams' score, with a catchy melody line by brilliant brass in the Late Romanticism taste, annoyingly accentuates every single action.",jazzest19,July/2004,3, Typical American Mainstream Cinema in the Early 80s,0,"[adventure, flick, mix, western, movie, formula, special, effect, infant, day, represents, american, mainstream, cinema, early, many, way, protagonist, indiana, jones, harrison, ford, scholar, action, hero, combination, unique, uniqueness, nothing, character, development, seems, result, filmmaker, thoughtless, decision, portrayal, heroine, marion, ravenwood, karen, allen, also, inconsistent, sometimes, tough, independent, frail, dependent, indiana, jones, time, along, drag, optimistic, story, overly, stretch, action, scene, may, beyond, audience, attention, span, reaganomix, overshadows, plot, american, whatever, want, foreign, place, south, america, nepal, cairo, set, nepal, cairo, look, nothing, set, john, williams, score, catchy, melody, line, brilliant, brass, late, romanticism, taste, annoyingly, accentuates, every, single, action]","[this adventure flick, mixes, the western movie formula, special effects, in, their infant days, represents, the american mainstream cinema, in, early, in, many ways, the protagonist indiana jones, harrison ford, is, a scholar, an action hero, this combination, is, unique, the uniqueness, has, nothing, to, do, with, the character development, seems, to, be, the result, of, the filmmakers, thoughtless decision, the portrayal, of, the heroine marion ravenwood, karen allen, is, also inconsistent, sometimes, she, is, tough and independent, while, frail and dependent, on, indiana jones, in, the other times, along with, dragging, optimistic story, overly stretched, action scenes, may be, beyond, the audience, attention span, the reaganomix, overshadows, the plot, where, the americans, can do, whatever, they, want, in, foreign places, south america, nepal, cairo, the sets, of, nepal and cairo look nothing, sets, while, john williams, score, with, a catchy melody line, by, brilliant brass, in, the late romanticism taste, annoyingly accentuates, every single action]",-92.214590511923,-6.989510176407848,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,3,2,4,4,2,0,0,4,4,5,6.633333333333334,90,99,adventure flick mixes western movie formula special effects infant days represents american mainstream cinema early 80s many ways protagonist indiana jones harrison ford scholar action hero combination unique uniqueness nothing character development seems result filmmakers thoughtless decision portrayal heroine marion ravenwood karen allen inconsistent sometimes tough independent frail dependent indiana jones times along dragging optimistic story overly stretched action scenes may beyond audiences attention span reaganomix overshadows plot americans whatever want foreign places south america nepal cairo sets nepal cairo look nothing sets john williams score catchy melody line brilliant brass late romanticism taste annoyingly accentuates every single action,0.04687208216619981,0.38053221288515404,1
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) - IMDb,"I know that there are a lot of haters when it comes to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, it has it's flaws and is by no means the strongest movie of the Indiana Jones series, but I just have so many good memories about this film and still to this day when I watch it, it gives me chills and excitement. The characters are memorable, the script is great, and Indiana is still pulling in the action packed excitement continuing from Raiders of the Lost Ark. The direction, editing, even the special effects are great. You have to love Short Round and Willy, the two new side kicks to Indiana's new adventure. Now I agree, Willy can get a little annoying here and there, but she was just so hilarious in that scene with the bugs and having to save Indiana and Short Round. Plus, Short Round has some of the most memorable lines of the entire series ""Okey, dokey, Dr. Jones, hold on to your potato!"", cheesy, but so funny. Harrison Ford still has Indiana down to a tee, this was the role that was meant for him.In this prequel, we start off in China on a trade off gone wrong with Lao Che, he ends up meeting a beautiful and very high maintence American girl, Willie. They escape together with Indiana's little side kick, Short Round and accidentally without knowing, they've escaped onto Lao Che's air plane. They wind up in India, where they find out about these rocks that can restore the village they're in, also the children have been kidnapped by Mola Ram and Indiana must free the kids and restore the rocks so the village can be safe again.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a fun sequel, I don't know why people complain so much about it. I can understand if people say it's the weakest of the series, but on it's own, this is a fantastic movie. It's one of my biggest recommendations to my friends as well as other film viewers. It just has everything you could want: action, romance, alligators, and heart sacrifices, lol, OK, that sounded gross, just trust me this that this is such a fun movie. It's one of my favorite films, I know that sounds bad, but I just love this film. It's a lot of fun and Indiana and Short Round are just the best buddies to watch argue on screen.

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) - IMDb,"This movie is proof that directors often don't understand their own franchises. Although Lucas has offered regrets for this bomb, it's the Spielbergian touches that make it so irritating. Claims that audiences were turned off because it was darker than the original are just goofy. This material was risible because it was infinitely more juvenile than what people expected.First they abandon real-world historical/biblical artifacts to make room for the crappiest MacGuffin to make people ever run around a movie (magic stones!?). We get antics in place of thrills; a bug and critter dinner menu (!?) a sequence with Capshaw frightened of everything. We get Kate Capshaw, shrieking and being girly until viewers pray for a character to put her out of our misery. We get Spielberg foisting crowds of children onto us when the first movie was blissfully free of children. Here, a kid is the shrieking protagonist (Short Round), kids are the victims (hordes of kidnapped & enslaved kiddies) and a kid is the villain (Prince something-or-other). And as the final disgrace, Spielberg can't bring himself to kill the kid villain and just has him demure & apologize the exact moment moral balance is restored. Terrible scripting.

Ip Man (2008) - IMDb,"Donnie Yen is a long time favorite of mine, although this is mainly due to his martial arts skills and screen presence rather than his acting skills. In Ip Man (or Ye Wen, as they were shouting in the seats next to mine) he delivers a truly solid performance on the acting side, carrying the burden of a nation on his shoulders with gravitas, at least that's what he conveyed to the audience at the cinema. They were actually applauding at times. Then again, moviegoers might be more absorbed over here on a regular basis. I digress.I'm not going to delve deeper into plot details. The basic stuff is already outlined above, and I also feel the historical accuracy of certain events depicted can be debated. That's a bit of a moot point, though, since most people will watch this for the action scenes. Nobody will be disappointed. Donnie kicks twelve kinds of ass in this movie, and it is all accompanied by some of the meanest sound design I've ever heard. Every one of his rapid punches can be felt as he pummels the poor bastards in his way with the Ip Man-style of martial arts (imdb won't let me spell out the name for some reason). The final bout is epic,but for me it was one scene about halfway through that got my heart beating faster. It involves Donnie, ten Japanese karate practitioners and some of the most furious fighting I've ever seen on screen. You can really sense the anger of his character in this scene. Great stuff.The film moves forward at a brisk pace and contains a surprisingly large amount of fight scenes. It totally lacks the vintage over-the-top-aesthetics of Donnie Yen's films of the 80's and 90's, but for some people that's a good thing. I personally think this is his finest performance to date.

Ip Man 2 (2010) - IMDb,"Donnie Yen returns as the titular kung fu grandmaster in Ip Man 2, with Wilson Yip reassuming his directorial duties and, most importantly, Sammo Hung back in his role as action director, and also as a main character.The story picks up from where the first movie left off. Ip, having survived the war period in Foshan, moves to Hong Kong with his family and attempts to make a living teaching his beloved art of Wing Chun boxing. However, he is met with opposition and hardship in the form of rival martial arts schools and the atypical British oppressors, and finds that even his formidable martial arts prowess may not be enough to resolve these problems.But the story aside, anyone with a little background knowledge of this film should know what to expect; a dose of intense Hong Kong kung fu film action. As the story begins to drag, at some point even a unsuspecting viewer should have realized that all the plot devices and dialogue serve little purpose other than as catalysts leading to the combat scenes. And at helm of the fight scenes is none other than the legendary Sammo Hung, in familiar territory choreographing the Wing Chun style, which he made a name for himself in movies such as The Prodigal Son in the 80s. With some creative input of his own, he manages to compose complex and graceful fight sequences that stays true to traditional kung fu styles, from Praying Mantis to Hung Gar Kuen. And who better to bring his imagination to life than the ever reliable Donnie Yen? What Hung designs, Yen executes with masterful control and precision. And in the movie when the former steps up to challenge the latter in a sparring session, we witness two of Hong Kong's greatest kung fu stars pushing themselves doing what they're best at in a brilliant exchange of strikes and blows. Absolutely a sight to behold.In the end, the typical viewer is unlikely to be captivated by the highly borrowed storyline, save for some who still enjoy the cinematic display of Chinese pride that is rather blatant and unsubtle. But you will be blown away by the fights, you will be in awe of the moves, and, if you're able to, appreciate the action scenes not as the mindless, disposable portion of the movie, but rather the core of it, carefully thought out, executed, and filmed as a true form of art. With that, forgive the storyline, and enjoy the film for what it is.",loccomotive200028,April/2010,8, Where action becomes an art form.,1,"[donnie, yen, return, titular, kung, fu, grandmaster, ip, man, wilson, yip, reassuming, directorial, duty, importantly, sammo, hung, back, role, action, director, also, main, story, pick, first, movie, left, ip, survive, war, period, foshan, move, hong, kong, family, attempt, make, living, teach, beloved, art, wing, chun, boxing, however, met, opposition, hardship, form, rival, martial, art, school, atypical, british, oppressor, find, even, formidable, martial, art, prowess, may, enough, resolve, story, aside, anyone, little, background, knowledge, film, know, expect, dose, intense, hong, kong, kung, fu, film, action, story, begin, drag, point, even, unsuspecting, viewer, realize, plot, device, dialogue, serve, little, purpose, catalyst, lead, ...]","[donnie yen returns, as, the titular kung fu grandmaster, in, ip man, with, wilson yip, reassuming, his directorial duties, most importantly, sammo, hung, back, in, his role, as, action director, also, as, a main character.the story, picks, up from, where, the first movie, left, off, ip, having survived, the war period, in, foshan, moves, to, hong kong, with, his family and attempts, to, make, living, teaching, his beloved art, of, wing chun boxing, however, he, is met, with, opposition and hardship, in, the form, of, rival martial arts schools, the atypical british oppressors, finds, that, even, his, formidable martial arts, prowess may not be, enough, to, resolve, problems.but, the story, aside, anyone, with, a little background knowledge, of, this film, should know, to, expect, a dose, of, intense hong kong kung fu film action, as, the story, begins, to, drag, at, some point, even, a unsuspecting viewer, should have realized, that, all the plot devices, dialogue serve, little purpose, other, than as, catalysts, leading, to, the combat scenes, at, helm, of, the fight scenes, ...]",57.23497132204773,-11.310801270224594,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,1,4,0,5,0,4,6.045714285714285,175,222,donnie yen returns titular kung fu grandmaster ip man 2 wilson yip reassuming directorial duties importantly sammo hung role action director main character story picks first movie left ip survived war period foshan moves hong kong family attempts living teaching beloved art wing chun boxing however met opposition hardship form rival martial arts schools atypical british oppressors finds even formidable martial arts prowess may enough resolve problems story aside anyone little background knowledge film know expect dose intense hong kong kung fu film action story begins drag point even unsuspecting viewer realized plot devices dialogue serve little purpose catalysts leading combat scenes helm fight scenes none legendary sammo hung familiar territory choreographing wing chun style made name movies prodigal son 80s creative input manages compose complex graceful fight sequences stays true traditional kung fu styles praying mantis hung gar kuen better bring imagination life ever reliable donnie yen hung designs yen executes masterful control precision movie former steps challenge latter sparring session witness hong kongs greatest kung fu stars pushing best brilliant exchange strikes blows absolutely sight behold end typical viewer unlikely captivated highly borrowed storyline save still enjoy cinematic display chinese pride rather blatant unsubtle blown away fights awe moves able appreciate action scenes mindless disposable portion movie rather core carefully thought executed filmed true form art forgive storyline enjoy film,0.19340909090909095,0.48301136363636366,1
Ip Man 2 (2010) - IMDb,"Donnie Yen returns in this rushed sequel to the far superior Yip Man. While the first film offered startling and far more brutal martial arts action than previous entries, there is nothing new or original in the second installment. The film is basically two halves of different stories mashed together. Yip Man's struggle to continue teaching Wing Chun while resisting the local martial arts schools as they attempt to extort money from him. Sammo Hung (the lead antagonist in the first half) shows some decidedly corrupt and criminal behavior but ends the film as a hallowed saint. Midway the story falls back on the previous films theme - Chinese Nationalism. The evil Japanese are now replaced by colonialist British administering post-war Hong Kong. The white characters are all portrayed as cartoon villains, right down to the dastardly laughs and blatant derision for the Chinese. The film fails to mention that the real Yip Man moved to British Hong Kong to avoid oppression and death from his fellow mainland Chinese. Yip Man and Master Hong suddenly bury their feud in the face of British Boxer ""Twister"" who in a page ripped from Rocky 4 later kills Master Hong in the ring after insulting Chinese martial arts. Towards the end there arises a hatred of westerners that was not present or even indicated for most of the film. Returning characters are little used such as Simon Yam, and Lynn Hung is just there to nag Yip about money. New younger characters look as if they've just stepped out a boy band video. The fights throughout are competent but nothing new and use more wire work than before, with men in their 50s/60s doing acrobatics while fighting.

Iron Monkey (1993) - IMDb,"Version: Universal Studios / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD release. Cantonese / English subtitles.I first saw 'Iron Monkey' on an old, poor-quality VHS release with dodgy English subtitles placed underneath really big and bright Chinese subtitles that took up half of the screen space. You know the type I'm talking about. Even then, my immediate reaction was ""AWESOME WOW AWESOME"".The corrupt officials of a Chinese province find themselves the target of Iron Monkey (Rongguang Yu), a sort of Chinese Robin Hood. When Wong Kei Ying (Donnie Yen) and a young Wong Fei Hung (Sze-Man Tsang) arrive in town, Kei Ying is forced to help the corrupt authorities track down Iron Monkey. Naturally, things get complicated when a group of Shaolin rebels arrive in town. Led by Hin Hung (Yee Kwan Yan) these evil Shaolin Monks and Nuns have been paid take out our heroes, leaving Iron Monkey, Kei Ying, Fei Hung, and Miss Orchid (Jean Wang) to kick many an evil-doers arse.The story in 'Iron Monkey' serves only as a device to allow for more fighting. Things that might usually be kept secret are revealed nearly straight away, just to avoid any major plot twists and allow for more kung-fu time. In fact, in 'Iron Monkey', kung-fu time occurs much more frequently then plot-development time, and whenever a plot-development moment comes along, it usually accompanied by kung-fu time. Awesome.We all know that Donnie Yen and Rongguang Yu are awesome. They spend a good deal of time putting on some awesome fight scenes. Jean Wang and Sze-Man Tsang (who, in Monkey Magic style, is actually a girl) pull of some really cool action sequences. Granted, most of it is grounded in fantasy, much like 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and friends, but it still looks really cool, and a few of these fights are easily some of my favourite fight-scenes ever. Also, the technique names rule. I wish I could perform a no-shadow kick or a King Kong palm.'Iron Monkey' is nearly nothing but martial arts fantasy. Fans of Hong Kong wuxia movies will get a kick out of this, as will action fans in general. Fans of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', 'Hero', and 'House of Flying Daggers' should see this to see how wuxia should be done, but they may not like it.

Iron Monkey (1993) - IMDb,"I have forever been a fan of the old Wu-Tang and Shaolin kung fu movies. They relied on incredible martial arts and flashy moves, and achieved greatness in their simplicity.

God help us... overrated. No way. If anything, it is UNDERrated. I see people complaining about the endless shouting, the over the top slapstick, the brashness, the loudness, the length. I can only conclude that these people are a bunch of humorless dorks.First of all, you can't just sit down to watch a three hour movie without knowing what you're in for. This is not your typical comedy--this is an EPIC comedy, the first of its kind, that inspired other such epics as ""Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines"" and ""The Great Race"" (which happens to be my favorite comedy--in fact, I'd like to say it's the better movie, but props go to this one for inventing the genre). And I can't speak for everyone else, but this movie leaves me laughing from start to finish.Yes, it is very long, but it NEVER has a dull moment. Even if the amazing car stunts aren't particularly funny, you can't tell me they aren't wildly entertaining. I have yet to see an action movie with better car chases than these. And yes, the slapstick is ridiculously over the top, although I can't see how that's a problem (the gas station scene is one of the funniest in movie history, in my opinion). But underneath all the slapstick and shouting, holding the whole movie together, is that incredibly cynical message. It is a movie about kind, decent folks turning into law-breaking lunatics and ruining their lives for the sake of money. The subplot with Spencer Tracey realizing his entire life has been a waste, and then ruining what life he has left, is one of the most tragic story lines I have seen. But it's also pretty darn funny.All the critics need to lighten up and see this for the absurd, delirious, hysterical farce it is.10/10 stars.",Chromium_55,March/2005,10," Greatest comedy of all time, period.",1,"[never, plan, write, review, movie, take, stroll, user, comment, shock, people, think, god, help, u, overrate, way, anything, underrated, see, people, complain, endless, shout, top, slapstick, brashness, loudness, length, conclude, people, bunch, humorless, sit, watch, three, hour, movie, without, know, typical, comedy, epic, comedy, first, kind, inspire, epic, magnificent, men, fly, machine, great, race, happens, favorite, comedy, fact, would, like, say, better, movie, prop, go, one, invent, genre, speak, everyone, else, movie, leaf, laugh, start, long, never, dull, moment, even, amaze, car, stunt, particularly, funny, tell, wildly, entertain, yet, see, action, movie, better, car, chase, yes, slapstick, ridiculously, top, although, ...]","[i, never planned, to, write, a review, for, this movie, until, i, took, a stroll, through, the user comments, was shocked, at, all the people, think, it, is, god help us, overrated, no way, if, anything, it, is underrated, i see people, complaining, about, the endless shouting, the over, the top slapstick, the brashness, the loudness, the length, i, can only conclude, that, these people, are, a bunch, of, humorless dorks.first, of, you, cannot just sit, down, to, watch, a three hour movie, without, knowing, you, are, in, for, is, not, your, typical comedy--this, is, an epic comedy, the first, of, its kind, that, inspired, other such epics, as, those magnificent men, in, their flying machines, the great race, happens, to, be, my favorite comedy--in fact, i, would, like to, say, it, is, the better movie, props, go, to, for, inventing, the genre, i, cannot speak, for, everyone, else, this movie, leaves, me, laughing, from, ...]",-25.936884905655212,-8.070320566574328,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,4,0,2,0,2,0,2,5.6614173228346445,127,154,never planned write review movie took stroll user comments shocked people think god help us overrated way anything underrated people complaining endless shouting top slapstick brashness loudness length conclude people bunch humorless dorks first sit watch hour movie without knowing typical comedy epic comedy first kind inspired epics magnificent men flying machines great race happens favorite comedy fact would like better movie props inventing genre speak everyone else movie leaves laughing start finish yes long never dull moment even amazing car stunts particularly funny wildly entertaining yet action movie better car chases yes slapstick ridiculously top although problem gas station scene funniest movie history opinion underneath slapstick shouting holding whole movie together incredibly cynical message movie kind decent folks turning law breaking lunatics ruining lives sake money subplot spencer tracey realizing entire life waste ruining life left tragic story lines seen pretty darn funny critics need lighten absurd delirious hysterical farce 10 10 stars,0.12335858585858588,0.6426767676767676,1

Jason X (2001) - IMDb,"SPOILER: Uber Jason in outer space I don't mind the film and it is a guilty pleasure of mine. I saw this movie in the video store 11 years ago when I was in high school I saw the VHS cover of the film and I saw it on DVD. So finally I got this film on Blu-ray disc just finish it watching it today and I must say it is not a bad film I like it a lot. Like I said it is a guilty pleasure of mine. I know a lot of people hate this film I don't. I think is MILES way better then Jason Goes to Hell and Miles way better movie then Hellraiser: Bloodline that was in outer space this movie is just better.7.years ago when I become a fan of Supernatural I heard that Jared Padalecki will be in the reboot Friday the 13th movie I rushed to see this movie. I watch Friday the 13th the original, Friday the 13th Part 2, the (2009) reboot and this film Jason X and yes I like it.I thought this movie will copy Alien and Aliens but it didn't copy any of those films it was solid and it was original it had his own story. I didn't thought this movie was bad I thought it was an interesting story that had a good action and a good slasher kills.Lexa Doig was an alright as the final girl tough it was a science fiction film it was still good and I will still watching it. Lexa Doig was in The Tracker with Casper Van Dien and I liked that action film I haven't seen in a while.Jason Voorhees returns with a new look, a new machete, and his same murderous attitude as he is awakened on a spaceship in the 25th century.Lexa Doig worked in facility Crystal Lake in which they capture Jason Voorhees but he kills everyone and escapes but Rowan Lafontaine (Lexa Doig) freeze him and her self in 2008. The year is now 2455 and a new crew members on a ship unfroze those two only too realize they unfroze Jason Voorhees unstoppable killing machine. Now a new group of soldiers tries to defeat Jason who later becomes Uber Jason.Lisa Ryder was great, sexy and really hot as Kay-Em 14 I liked her, she really kicked Jason's ass and she shot him to death ha ha.So it is scary? No. Is it a good movie? No. Is it fun? VERY.I also forgot this movie is reference to Demolition Man (1993) my all time favorite futuristic action Stallone film. In which they were mention to Lexa Doig's character that she was in Cryo it references to Cryo-prison it is similar to Demolition Man.Jason X is a 2001 American science fiction slasher film produced and directed by James Isaac. It is the tenth installment in the Friday the 13th film series and stars Kane Hodder in his fourth and final film appearance as the undead mass murderer Jason Voorhees and his futuristic counterpart, Uber Jason.This movie get's a C+ 6/10 wasn't that bad of a film but wasn't a great Jason slasher film either, but still it is my all time favorite guilty pleasure of mine.I have enjoyed this movie and I had fun watching it.

Jason X (2001) - IMDb,"Let's face it, if you're going to rent one of the later movies in a slasher movie series, you'd be an idiot to expect high art. The fact that this is the tenth movie in the Friday the 13th franchise, the most knuckle-draggingly, ball-scratchingly cretinous 'horror' series of all time AND it's set in space doesn't exactly suggest that this'll be an all-time classic, but it's a good fun way to kill an hour and thirty minutes nonetheless.Okay, the plot is so thin even a slight breeze would make it disintegrate and the horror element is practically non-existent but then Jason movies abandoned that long ago in favour of just providing dumb escapism with inventive and bloody death scenes, which this film certainly provides. People are sliced in half, impaled on large spikes, blown up, one poor woman even getting her head dunked in liquid nitrogen and shattered on a desk, but the characters are so one-dimensional and it's so cheesy you're more likely to laugh than scream. And I defy you to watch the scene when Jason gets transformed into 'Uber Jason' for the first time and not have a colossal grin traverse your face. There's even a later scene which pokes fun at the earlier movie's clichés with a hilarious ""beating one camper to death with the other"" sequence.This is not The Exorcist, it's not The Omen, it's even a very long way away from the original Friday The 13th, but as director James Isaac has said, ""it's just fun.""

Jeepers Creepers III (2017) - IMDb,"What were they doing in those 14 years between 2 and 3, staring at their shoelaces? I love the first two films because they are both scary and well made, but WOW, this film is GARBAGE. TRUST ME, this is coming from a HUGE JC fan! The film takes place between the 1st and 2nd movie, which is dumb because nobody wanted to see what happened between the 1st and 2nd movie. I wanted to see what happened after the 2nd movie, but even then, it's really confusing because the plot keeps jumping back and forth between all of these dumb characters. I couldn't tell if the film was set in the present day, in 2001, or in the 70's because of the craptastic pacing. There's even a scene where you can see a 2016 Chevy truck in a film that supposedly takes place in 2001. Speaking of pacing, there is none! Nothing happens in this movie and the film ends right when it should've started! There are so many characters that the film gets lost in itself. The first film had Darry and Trish, simple and easy. The 2nd film had the athletes and a side-plot revolving around an angry father, but it was still easy to follow and well balanced. Here, we have an old lady getting visions from her dead son, then we have Sargeant Tubbs from the first movie, then we have the anti-Creeper gang, then we have some teenagers, then we have a country boy who has a crush on a girl, and said girl also gets her own storyline. All the characters are pointless and are not flushed out because the film is trying so hard to give equal focus to everyone. The CGI is SO BAD and is EVERYWHERE in the film. It's so bad that my theater was laughing louder than the actual movie! The Creeper doesn't do ANYTHING, no smelling fear, eating body parts, he just sorta walks around and grunts. There's one good scene where a group of teenage bikers finds The Creepers truck in the woods, and it's the only good scene in the entire film. That's it! Worst of all, WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE CREEPERS'S ORIGINS!!! I've been waiting nearly 2 decades and we STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE HE COMES FROM???

The director of movies such as ""Laagan"" and ""Swades,"" has once again left no stones unturned and proved that he is also capable of directing a movie related the colossal personality - Akbar the Great, also known as ""Jalaludin Mohammed Akbar."" A young Akbar, sets out to conquer Kingdoms and those who don't join him, are brutally executed but after a while he begins to pardon them and that's when many of his opponents begin to realise that they had and have, misunderstood him. One particular Rajput Raja Bharmal, instead of facing the Moghul's mighty army, decides that it would be better that his daughter, Raj Kumari Jodhaa Bai, who is be throned to another Rajput Prince, marries Akbar. The couple do unite in marriage but only after Akbar agrees to the two conditions which the Rajput Princess has put forward. At the same time, he has to win her heart as well as to look after the interest of his public.Jodhaa Akbar, which stars Hrithik Roshan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Khulbhushan Kharbanda, Suhasini Mulay, Digvijay Purchit and Punam S. Sinha, is a romantic, biographical and historical movie, which is set in a era of revolt, conspiracies and war. It also deals with intercaste marriage, which at the time was not heard off due to the fact that when the Mughals invaded India, the Rajput Princesses and Queens became Sati when their husbands, the Kings were killed in battle so as not to be captured and, or, forced to live with the Invaders.Hrithik Roshan, son of the director and producer, Rakesh Roshan and nephew of the music director Rajesh Roshan, was offered this role as the director, Ashutosh Gowariker, who had seen him in ""Koi Mil Gaya."" believed that he was capable of doing justice to this part and also because of his physique. His natural choice for the lead of ""Jodhaa Bai"" was Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, not only just because of her beauty but talent as well. He has proved to be correct with the cast - brilliant as they have done justice to their respective parts.This is a well written story by Haider Ali, and co written, directed and produced by Ashutosh Gowariker, which has gone into great details with research and choosing sites for filming. The cinematography, by Kiran Deohams, is excellent and some cases breath taking. The music, by A.R. Rehman, is pleasant and suits the genre movie and the songs, though a few, are good as well and especially the wedding night song. The costumes and jewellery, which I am sure that a lot of the members of the audience, will be looking out for, designed by the famous Neeta Lulla, is elegant. The stunts and the fight sequences, which are well timed, and though they look dangerous at times, are worthwhile watching. In one scene, where Akbar is seen fighting an elephant, actor Hrithik Roshan did get injured but continued with the filming. His injuries were related to those of when he was filming for ""Krissh."" But really pushes the fight and stunt sequences, is the special effects by Pankaj Khandpur, which are worth to watch.Conclusion: This movie has all the ingredients to become a classic, epic movie in the future, even though it is three and a half hours in duration. It is worth it.For those interested in a bit of gossip. Hrithik Roshan, who has been offered to work in some Hollywood movies, may not have to go over to in at least one of them. The reason being is that actress Penelope Cruz, may be working with him in a yet untitled Bollywood movie, which is said to be directed by his father, Rakesh Roshan. Could it be that this is just the beginning of a merger between Hollywood and Bollywood? I wonder! Elsewhere, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, is soon to be working in a movie with the ""Mahatama,"" Ben Kingsley, with whom she has worked with before, in an English version of ""Taj Mahal."" It seems like that she can't keep away from the family.",Pratik11219,February/2008,10, What Can Be Said?

Jodhaa Akbar (2008) - IMDb,"The director and writer Ashutosh Gowarikar could have done a much, much better job of making this movie more interesting had he (1) included the character of Emperor Akbar's Prime Minister Birbal, (2) stayed away from the same old boring 'singing and dancing' Bollywood pattern, and (3) limited the run time of the movie to at the most 2.5 hours. The movie is at a ridiculously boring length of 3 hours and 28 minutes. And that is sans the last credits for which I did not even stay back as I had to rush to the pharmacy as fast as I could before my head exploded with headache I got by going to this movie. I usually make it a point to stay back until all the credits are over.The first hint of the treacherous movie ahead came when Emperor Akbar joined the Sufi Quawwals to dance at the end of the first song. I am still wondering after 24 hours of watching this movie if this song by people of Sufi sect was to supposed to reflect on Akbar's spiritual inclinations or if it was part of a comedy. With choreography of this song and Emperor Akbar joining the dancers, it looked nothing but comic.The romance scenes between Jodhaa and Akbar didn't seem to be that romantic. Definitely, they were stretched like a rubber band. The limitations put forth on Ashutosh Gowarikar by Aisharya herself and by the rest of the Bachchan family must have played a role here. Hollywood director, actors, and actresses do a much better job in this department. One would think that the limitations put on both Jodhaa and Akbar by being part of the Mughal royalty may have something to do with it. But it didn't seem so later as they were shot singing and dancing to this century's tunes. At some point, I almost anticipated Hritik Roshan to act like Rajesh Khanna or Dev Anand. I think, Ashotosh Gowarikar (and all of us) would have been in a much better position if Gowarikar had used the old and proved Bollywood trick of using two flowers or two birds or one flower and one bee while shooting these scenes.There were at least 3-4 places in the movie where the script and/or the situation suddenly became very weak. For example, when the character of 'Maham Anga' uses a Hindi word 'Naataa' (for relation) rather than using an Urdu word 'Rishta' or when an ordinary maid servant completes a sentence accusing 'Maham Anga' of exploiting Jodhaa's letter to her brother. Since 'Maham Anga' was held in very high esteem by Emperor Akbar, it would have suited if the maid servant would just leave her sentence halfway being afraid of 'Maham Anga'.I have watched other period movies made by non-Indian directors. They never seemed to be so boring even though they didn't have lavish sets and lavish costumes. And you know what, some of them like 'Gandhi' have won Oscar awards for Best Film, Best Actor, etc. Now some people may start arguing saying that 'we should not attach much importance to Oscar awards...' etc. But the same people were tremendously happy when 'Lagaan' was nominated for Oscar awards and the same people were heartbroken when 'Lagaan' didn't win.That apart, I won't be surprised if 'Jodhaa Akbar' becomes India's official entry for 2009 Oscar Awards. Afterall, there is someone from the Bachchan clan in this movie.On an average this movie is just another piece of Bollywood trash.",Kedar_Risbud17,February/2008,1, Extra-boring Bollywood melodrama.....,0,"[director, writer, ashutosh, gowarikar, could, do, much, much, better, job, make, movie, interest, include, character, emperor, akbar, prime, minister, birbal, stayed, away, old, boring, dance, bollywood, pattern, limited, run, time, movie, hour, movie, ridiculously, boring, length, hour, minute, sans, last, credit, even, stay, back, rush, pharmacy, fast, could, head, explode, headache, get, go, movie, usually, make, point, stay, back, credit, first, hint, treacherous, movie, ahead, come, emperor, akbar, join, sufi, quawwals, dance, end, first, song, still, wonder, hour, watch, movie, song, people, sufi, sect, suppose, reflect, akbar, spiritual, inclination, part, comedy, choreography, song, emperor, akbar, join, dancer, look, nothing, romance, ...]","[the director, writer ashutosh gowarikar, could have done, a much, much better job, of, making, this movie, more, interesting, had, he, included, the character, of, emperor akbar, prime minister, birbal, stayed, away, from, the same old boring, singing, dancing, bollywood pattern, limited, the run time, of, the movie, to at, most, 2.5 hours, the movie, is, at, a ridiculously boring length, of, 3 hours, 28 minutes, is sans, the last credits, for, which i, did not even stay, back, as, i, had, to, rush, to, the pharmacy, as fast, as, i, could, before, my head, exploded, with, headache i, got, by, going, to, this movie, i, usually make, it a point, to, stay, back, until, all the credits, are, over.the first hint, of, the treacherous movie, ahead came, when, emperor akbar, joined, the sufi quawwals, to, dance, at, the end, of, the first song, i, am still wondering, after, 24 hours, of, watching, this movie, if, this song, by, people, ...]",152.87037145487312,6.65939063570471,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,0,3,3,1,1,4,1,1,1,0,1,5,0,5.622641509433962,212,312,director writer ashutosh gowarikar could done much much better job making movie interesting 1 included character emperor akbars prime minister birbal 2 stayed away old boring singing dancing bollywood pattern 3 limited run time movie 2 5 hours movie ridiculously boring length 3 hours 28 minutes sans last credits even stay rush pharmacy fast could head exploded headache got going movie usually point stay credits first hint treacherous movie ahead came emperor akbar joined sufi quawwals dance end first song still wondering 24 hours watching movie song people sufi sect supposed reflect akbars spiritual inclinations part comedy choreography song emperor akbar joining dancers looked nothing comic romance scenes jodhaa akbar seem romantic definitely stretched like rubber band limitations put forth ashutosh gowarikar aisharya rest bachchan family must played role hollywood director actors actresses much better job department would think limitations put jodhaa akbar part mughal royalty may something seem later shot singing dancing centurys tunes point almost anticipated hritik roshan act like rajesh khanna dev anand think ashotosh gowarikar us would much better position gowarikar used old proved bollywood trick using flowers birds flower bee shooting scenes least 3 4 places movie script situation suddenly became weak example character maham anga uses hindi word naataa relation rather using urdu word rishta ordinary maid servant completes sentence accusing maham anga exploiting jodhaas letter brother since maham anga held high esteem emperor akbar would suited maid servant would leave sentence halfway afraid maham anga watched period movies made non indian directors never seemed boring even though lavish sets lavish costumes know like gandhi oscar awards best film best actor etc people may start arguing saying attach much importance oscar awards etc people tremendously happy lagaan nominated oscar awards people heartbroken lagaan win apart surprised jodhaa akbar becomes indias official entry 2009 oscar awards afterall someone bachchan clan movie average movie another piece bollywood trash,0.06556277056277059,0.4613492063492064,1

Jonah Hex (2010) - IMDb,"Sometimes I wonder if people that reviewed this film actually watched it, or if they gave it a chance, not like second glancing at it because they're cooking dinner at the same time.Jonah Hex is an entertaining little movie based upon the DC Comic Book character. To be honest, I've never read the comic, had little expectations coming in, and wouldn't have gone to see this in the theater. This genre is admittedly, 'right up my alley'. Usually I check some ratings on here before renting movies so that I avoid the flops. Thankfully, I didn't look on IMDb until AFTER I had already rented it. So when I looked at IMDb's 4.6 user rating AFTER renting it, but BEFORE watching it; my expectations were lowered even further, and I nearly put off watching it, again. Nevertheless, it was due the next day and I popped it in the DVD player when the other-half went to bed(too bad - she would have liked it). I have a good sound system and a nice TV - both made this action/western/fantasy even better.Let's take a look at some of the films on IMDb with similar user ratings - specifically some of the worst films that I have ever seen/wasted my time and money on.Ready to Wear(Pret-A-Porter)4.8 Actually rated higher than Jonah Hex. This was two hours I will NEVER get back. A terribly boring movie with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.King Solomon's Mines 4.6 Tied with Jonah Hex. This may be the worst movie I have ever seen. A literal walk out of the theater. And I know what you're thinking. I talked about giving movies a chance earlier, but I revisited KSM years later, and it still remains the worst film I've ever seen in my lifetime, 1 and a half times. Toys 4.6 Enough said.Jonah Hex' style is true to the comic book theme. The opening of the film is excellent, and gives us a good foundation for an entertaining storyline. John Malkovich is ALWAYS a good adversary/bad guy, and Josh Brolin IS Jonah Hex. Megan Foxes' role is small, and she serves every purpose, much like a smoking hot Bond girl. Her Body alone makes this film worth 4.6.But, Jonah Hex is much more. It's interesting, it's action packed, and it's well-paced. Now, is it believable? No. What comic book based film is? Is it Oscar worthy? No. Will it appear on any legitimate 2010 Top Ten lists? No. Jonah Hex is the pure definition of a popcorn flick. Not just one that rare movie watchers might over-rate(It's no nine or ten), and one that critics will annihilate, but one that is sure to surprise many who give it a chance. It's worth the rental - especially if you have a TV and sound system that can give you a near theater experience. I like some of the subtle touches to this movie, and Malkovich and Brolin really help the cause.58/100You'll like it if you liked: Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer, Brotherhood of the Wolf, and Timecop.",witster1819,October/2010,6, A Complete Guide to a User Ratings Travesty,1,"[sometimes, wonder, people, review, film, actually, watch, give, chance, like, second, glance, cooking, dinner, hex, entertain, little, movie, base, upon, dc, comic, book, character, honest, never, read, comic, little, expectation, come, would, go, see, theater, genre, admittedly, alley, usually, check, rating, rent, movie, avoid, flop, thankfully, look, imdb, already, rent, look, imdb, user, rating, rent, watch, expectation, lower, even, nearly, put, watch, nevertheless, due, next, day, popped, dvd, player, go, bed, bad, would, like, good, sound, system, nice, tv, make, even, us, take, look, film, imdb, similar, user, rating, specifically, bad, film, ever, time, money, wear, actually, rat, high, jonah, ...]","[sometimes i wonder, if, people, that, reviewed, this film, actually watched, it, if, they, gave, it a chance, not, like, second glancing, at, it, because, they, are, cooking, dinner, at, the same time.jonah hex, is, entertaining, little movie, based, upon, the dc, comic book character, to, be, honest, i, have never read, the comic, had, little expectations, coming, in, would not have gone, to, see, this in, the theater, this genre, is, admittedly, right, up, my alley, usually i, check, some ratings, on, here, before, renting, movies, so that, i avoid, the flops, thankfully, i, did not look, on, imdb, until after, i, had already rented, it, so when, i, looked, at, imdb, 4.6 user rating, after, renting, it, before, watching, it, my expectations, were lowered, even further, i, nearly put, off, watching, it, again, nevertheless, it, was due, the next day, i, popped, it, ...]",120.42267445557378,7.059330800284164,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,1,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.3298969072164954,194,285,sometimes wonder people reviewed film actually watched gave chance like second glancing cooking dinner time jonah hex entertaining little movie based upon dc comic book character honest never read comic little expectations coming would gone theater genre admittedly right alley usually check ratings renting movies avoid flops thankfully look imdb already rented looked imdbs 4 6 user rating renting watching expectations lowered even nearly put watching nevertheless due next day popped dvd player half went bed bad would liked good sound system nice tv made action western fantasy even better let us take look films imdb similar user ratings specifically worst films ever seen wasted time money ready wear pret porter 4 8 actually rated higher jonah hex hours never terribly boring movie redeeming qualities whatsoever king solomons mines 4 6 tied jonah hex may worst movie ever seen literal walk theater know thinking talked giving movies chance earlier revisited ksm years later still remains worst film ever seen lifetime 1 half times toys 4 6 enough said jonah hex style true comic book theme opening film excellent gives us good foundation entertaining storyline john malkovich always good adversary bad guy josh brolin jonah hex megan foxes role small serves every purpose much like smoking hot bond girl body alone makes film worth 4 6 jonah hex much interesting action packed well paced believable comic book based film oscar worthy appear legitimate 2010 top ten lists jonah hex pure definition popcorn flick rare movie watchers might rate ten critics annihilate sure surprise many give chance worth rental especially tv sound system give near theater experience like subtle touches movie malkovich brolin really help cause 58 100you like liked fantastic rise silver surfer brotherhood wolf timecop,0.15782828282828282,0.49267075517075526,1
Jonah Hex (2010) - IMDb,"I wasn't really expecting much out of this film. And I thought that it coming out the same weekend as Toy Story 3 was pretty laughable. But it seemed like fun, so I thought I'd give it a try. Sadly, it turned out pretty much how I expected, and it's no wonder there was such little advertisement paid to this film. Jonah Hex is pretty straightforward in it's story. Jonah Hex witnessed his family die at the hands of John Turnbull. Unfortunately, for Hex, Turnbull died mysteriously in a hotel fire...or did he. Turns out Tunrbull is still alive and a danger to the US. Now, Jonah must get his revenge and save the US.A lot of people have compared this film to The Wild Wild West. Thankfully, this is not that film. Granted, it's not all that grounded in reality (actually, it's not grounded in reality much at all), but there's no giant walking spiders or head slicing, flying discs. The action here is pretty ridiculous and outrageous, but at the same is fun. It helps that Josh Brolin, as the titular Jonah Hex, is pretty damn cool. He plays off Dirty Harry pretty well, with only a few one liners and a pretty well drawn out character. In fact, I would say that if they ever do a remake of Dirty Harry, I would vote for Brolin to take up the reins. Unfortunately, most of the rest of the cast is not as good. John Malkovich plays Turnbull lazily. Sure, he's not as hammy as he could have been, which I am grateful for, but I can't help but feel that he isn't the least bit interested in what he is doing. And with the kind of character he's supposed to be, there should be more passion, but it's sadly missing. As for the third big name, Megan Fox does what she does best and looks hot in some slutty western dresses. For a film like this, I guess you can't ask much more from her.The action is obviously where this film is at, and it mostly delivers. It's far from the biggest action film this summer, but there are some pretty outrageous and entertaining pieces, like the Gatling gun-mounted horse and the dynamite gun scenes known from the trailer. And when there isn't action going on, Brolin saves the film. Besides the action, he is the best thing here. I would also even argue that the film does a good job translating the comic book style. While it could have been much better, it could also have been a lot worse.

Kangaroo Jack (2003) - IMDb,"Let's get to the point. Kangaroo Jack is necessarily the worst film of all time, but neither is it the greatest. It's not even close. What it is though is fairly humorous, though usually silly.The story is a bit good at parts, but far-fetched at others. Charlie and Louis were best friends ever since childhood, after one saved another from drowning. One of their fathers was a gangster or something, and the two are sent with a job to deliver the money to some other dude. The story isn't quite a bad one, and does take a little twist. (The twist is related to the job.) The main flaw in the story is that the movie is supposedly aimed at kids. Do you think kids will understand anything about mafia or anything like that?Despite that, there are other moments not aimed at kids. One of the jokes includes Charlie grabbing on of the other character's chest. Another scene includes a homophobic joke. (""We're having an intimate, non-gay moment.) The film is a bit funny and entertaining, but the farting and homophobic jokes, along with the strange storyline makes it less than what it could have been, but I still enjoyed it more than other films such as The Cat in the Hat, Scary Movie and Dude, Where's My Car? 5/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",patrick_dunne23,November/2005,5, Not as bad as everybody says it is- it's about average,0,"[let, u, get, point, kangaroo, jack, necessarily, bad, film, time, neither, great, even, close, though, fairly, humorous, though, usually, story, bit, good, part, others, charlie, louis, best, friend, ever, since, childhood, one, save, another, drown, one, father, gangster, something, two, sent, job, deliver, money, dude, story, quite, bad, one, take, little, twist, twist, related, job, main, flaw, story, movie, supposedly, aim, kid, think, kid, understand, anything, mafia, anything, like, despite, moment, aim, kid, one, joke, includes, charlie, grab, character, chest, another, scene, includes, homophobic, joke, intimate, moment, film, bit, funny, entertain, fart, homophobic, joke, along, strange, storyline, make, less, could, ...]","[let, us, get, to, the point, kangaroo jack, is, necessarily, the worst film, of, all time, is, it, greatest, it, is not even close, it, is, is, fairly humorous, though, usually silly.the story, is, a bit, good, at, parts, far-fetched, at, others, charlie and louis, were, best friends, ever, since, childhood, after, saved, from, drowning, of, their fathers, was, a gangster, something, are sent, with, a job, to, deliver, the money, to, some other dude, the story, is, not quite, bad, does take, a little twist, the twist, is related, to, the job, the main flaw, in, the story, is, that, the movie, is supposedly aimed, at, kids, do, you, think, kids, will understand anything, about, mafia or anything, like, that?despite, that, are, other moments, not aimed, at, kids, of, the jokes, includes, charlie, grabbing, on of, the other character, chest, another scene, includes, a homophobic joke, we, are having, ...]",-75.77817113405041,-1.0786042634704365,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,3,2,4,4,2,0,0,4,4,5,5.382978723404255,94,116,let us point kangaroo jack necessarily worst film time neither greatest even close though fairly humorous though usually silly story bit good parts far fetched others charlie louis best friends ever since childhood saved another drowning fathers gangster something sent job deliver money dude story quite bad take little twist twist related job main flaw story movie supposedly aimed kids think kids understand anything mafia anything like despite moments aimed kids jokes includes charlie grabbing characters chest another scene includes homophobic joke intimate non gay moment film bit funny entertaining farting homophobic jokes along strange storyline makes less could still enjoyed films cat hat scary movie dude car 5 10feel free send private message regarding comment,0.12519841269841273,0.65,1

Kaththi (2014) - IMDb,"I was encouraged to watch the movie and many friends recommended it on the lines that if you liked Ramana, you will like this movie. But for some reason, I found the script totally lacking common sense and showed the lack of depth in knowledge of the writers of the plot. The plot is centered around the struggles of villagers versus MNC(Corporate). The word MNC and corporate are overused in the movie, that it left such a bad taste to me. Maybe it would have been nice if someone explained Economics 101 to the writers of this movie. My distaste for the movie stems from the simplicity with which commercial Tamil movie makers want to handle the script - black versus white. Heroes versus villains. A lot of movies these days have transcended such stereotyping showing all possible greys, but this movie should have been made like 40 years ago, and then possibly it would have deserved all the praise. In fact a basic fact check would disprove the premise of the whole movie. Farmers earn more when they sell their land to acquiring corporates. It is simple market mechanism. If a beverage company dries out a river, it just means, we people are lazy and like to indulge in carbonated drinks. As long as there is demand, you cannot villify the firms for it. On a sidenote, both Pepsi and Coke follow sustainable practices for most part, and I would encourage the writers to check about it. And the farmers are none the poorer for selling their land to acquiring firms. See all the farmers driving BMWs in Gurgaon. And please for Godsake, companies do not collude as shown in the movie. If you want to switch off the real world and enjoy a masala cum emotional movie, then you will probably like this one.

Kick-Ass (2010) - IMDb,"I saw the previews for this and thought this was going to be one of those slapstick stupid comedy movies (Superbad, Super Hero Movie). I came on IMDb and saw the rating and the reviews and I thought I'd reconsider after doing some research on this. I was very wrong with my initial assessment. Yes, there's some teen comedic elements to this movie, but the movie flowed perfectly. Great Soundtrack, great fight scenes, acting was good, story was great and original. With a current IMDb rating of 8.3 as I write this, look's like I'm not alone on how I rated this movie. Show stealer was definitely Hit Girl. I foresee her having a huge career. Possibly the next Natalie Portman. Reminded me of Natalie's role in Leon. Which leads me to my next point. Unless you're into comic books, video games, in your teens/20's/30's and don't have a young kid, you might be taken aback that a little 11 year old girl is killing people and using bad words. For those that gave this a bad review because of that, do some research on a movie before you go see something that you think you won't like. I hate musicals and I'm not going to pay 10 bucks to see High School Musical and then come in here and complain that there was too much singing and dancing.

Kick-Ass (2010) - IMDb,"Nerdy kid, for no real reason buys a wet suit and becomes a ""superhero"". Along the way he clashes with the mob, their mole hero Red Mist and a little girl and her father who are also ""superheroes"".I'm under whelmed by this tale of teen angst turned toward acceptable violence. Sure its grand wish fulfillment for anyone who wanted to be Spiderman and Batman, but at the same time it seems like it was constructed by the same people looking for said fulfillment. Its the story of a geeky kid who get to beat people up, gets the girl and live happily ever after. The problem it has a story that not only has plot holes you could drive a truck through, but it shifts tones almost moment by moment. Is it serious? is it a joke? What exactly am I suppose to feel?

Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) - IMDb,"Having seen Tarantino's 3 previous films, going into the cinema, my expectations for 'Kill Bill' were already over the roof. However, regardless of my high hopes for quality entertainment, I was not prepared for this film. I was dumbfounded. I was blown away. I had quite simply never seen anything even remotely like it.In 'Kill Bill', the revenge plot serves only as a larger story arc, thus allowing Tarantino to play with as many different genres as he likes, and boy - what a mix he dishes out! With complete disregard for the conventions of filmmaking, he paints an expressionistic masterpiece in his own unique style, the likes of which the world has never seen before. Cinema rarely gets this exciting.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) - IMDb,"Spoiler Alert!!! I like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. The story line was strong in RD and less so in PF. PF, though, had interesting sub-plots that loosely wove together to make a good movie.I also see the genius in the dialog in RD and in the characters in Pulp Fiction. I was expecting to see something in this movie.Unfortunately, Kill Bill was not interesting, nor genius and did not have a plot. Basically, the main character was screwed over in a previous time in her life and made a top 5 hit-list of people from which to extract revenge.The way she extracts revenge is to engage in hand-to-hand or martial weapon on weapon combat. Of course, the protagonist wins the fights and the people are checked off the list.I think Luci Liu (sp?) is the 3rd person on the list. The movie goes into a 20 minute section on how she gets a Okinawan curved sword. Now armed with the best weapon, she takes on Liu's whole team of trained martial artists - and whips them all single handedly. I'm talking 20, 30, 40 individuals who all attack her at the same time in the same room. She still wins.Then, she battles the ""board leader"", and after sufficient scenery changes, she wins again.Each of these battles is full of graphic violence and blood, as you'd expect from the director (I won't try to spell his name). But, you can only show an arm getting lopped off and the resulting gieser of blood so many times. Wait, my mistake, you can show it for 2 hours if you are the movie Kill Bill.After the Liu's character is killed, #3 is checked off and the movie ends.There is no plot. The special effects and battle scenes were state of the art, but do not make a movie.I have no interest in ""Part 2"" because I have no interest in any of the characters or in more film about Uma killing people with swords. 2 hours was 1.5 hours too much.Two thumbs down.

Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) - IMDb,"It's a matter of some debate which volume of Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" is better. Let's end the argument right now: David Carradine doesn't even appear in ""Volume 1."" Hasn't the Academy mailed him his Best Supporting Actor Oscar already?In the first volume of ""Kill Bill,"" released only a few months before ""Vol. 2"" in the tail end of 2003, we met Uma Thurman, one peeded-off super-assassin taking out some folks from her past one at a time, with the occasional mega-posse thrown in for interest. ""Vol. 1"" had a lot of blood, violence, and wisecracks, and galloped across the screen like a rap video on steroids.""Vol. 2"" is way different. It makes sense it's a separate movie; the tone is such a departure from ""Vol. 1"" in two ways. One is style. Director Tarantino has fun stylistically quoting Sergio Leone and chop-fu cheapos from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Cinematic sampling is something he's good at and enjoys, but in ""Vol. 2"" he doesn't go as overboard as he does in ""Vol. 1."" He pulls back and lets the plot breathe, rather than filling every spare second with a homage-cum-parody that maybe a dozen lucky fans will get. Maybe some here wish he'd pile it on a bit more, but they have to make do with the goofy Pei Mai sequence, which is a flashback and hence not jarring in its ""Vol. 1""-style comic-book treatment. Throughout ""Vol. 2"" the emphasis is on storytelling and character-building, which is where it should be given we are now being asked to deepen our commitment of interest to these people. ""Vol. 1"" is okay for what it is, but its flash and action are no match for the depth and nuance of ""Vol. 2.""This gets to the second different tonal difference between the films, which is emotional. It all comes back to the characters. They don't quite become real people here, but they get close enough to get under your skin. Admittedly, the opening part of ""Vol. 2"" tests the viewer's patience a bit, there's some long bits that show the director hasn't really mastered self-discipline, like with Thurman's graveyard struggle, but the meandering usually has a purpose. Tarantino is building toward something here that has its payoff when Thurman's character finally has her face-to-face showdown with Carradine's Bill.From that moment forward to the end, this is the best Tarantino has ever been.Carradine and Thurman dominate the proceedings with two of the finest performances I've seen, certainly the best Tarantino has directed, playing off the mythology we've been taught in ""Vol. 1"" and developing resonances with the viewer both together and apart which will surprise those expecting a casual butt-kicking affair. We finally find out what Carradine means in the first line of ""Vol. 1"" where he tells a whimpering victim he is being masochistic, not sadistic, and its a powerful revelation, that this sinister baddie may have a heart buried under that cold exterior. Carradine is perfect in his phrasing, his pauses, the tired glint in his eye, or the way he says ""Kiddo."" You can't ask for a better veteran performance. For her part, Thurman presents a brilliantly conflicted character who can not stop either hating or loving Bill, and brings us not into a world of cartoon anguish, but real human pain.""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is slow-moving, and needs ""Vol. 1"" in a way few sequels do, since it assumes you know nearly all the characters coming in. That's a weakness. So are some undeniably pointless bits, including the entire sequence with Bill's father figure, Esteban Vihaio, and some business at a bar involving Michael Madsen, who plays a former assassin now gone to seed.Madsen's good, though, and so's Daryl Hannah as another rather mouthy assassin, Gordon Liu as Pei Mei, and especially Perla Haney-Jardine as a girl named B.B. The nice thing with Tarantino is for every scene that strikes a bum note, there's four or five that hit the right mark, and some manage to do much more. My favorite scene involves a Mexican standoff in an L.A. hotel room between Thurman's character and an anonymous hitwoman, at once grippingly suspenseful, hilarious, and life-affirming. Still, it's the final moments of this film that will stay with you, as Bill and his former pupil work out their ""unfinished business"" and we are left to ponder the results of their decisions and actions.""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" may not reach the heights of cinema to which it aspires, the level of ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly"" quoted in its score, but it's a fine film that will make most viewers glad they stuck around for the second installment.

Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) - IMDb,"Awful, boring, slow and tedious are just a few words that spring to mind when I recall having to sit through Kill Bill Vol 2. And those are the kindest words I can think of. A few more choice words would be crap, s***e, rubbish or just plain retarded.Now, I admit, I wasn't expecting KB Vol 1 rehashed, but I did expect something not too dissimilar from Vol 2. KB2 is to KB1 as The Sound of Music is to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The first film's non-stop action has been replaced almost entirely by non-stop dialogue. And not particular good dialogue either. In fact, I'll coin a new term here - dire-logue. The film is littered with it. Any film requires a certain amount of exposition, and even mystic claptrap like that in the Matrix movies. But KB Vol 2 takes claptrap to a new level that makes the Matrix movies look positively Spartan in terms of jibber-jabber. But the worst thing about the chatter in KB2 is the total and utter meaninglessness of most of it. It just drones on and on. A character makes a point verbally then, instead of getting on with the movie, the character is forced to belabour the point over and over until you're practically screaming at them to shut the Hell up and get on with it!Nor do the pointlessly long (and in fact, just pointless) extra scenes add to the film in any way. For example, we learn that Bud (Bill's brother) lives in a trailer and has a crappy job at a local bar as a bouncer. He's become a loser - a far cry from his assassin days. What I've just summarized in two sentences is dragged out on film over the course of perhaps twenty minutes or more, including an entirely tedious and unnecessary set of scenes involving Bud at work that add absolutely nothing whatsoever to the film and introduce characters that have no bearing on the movie at all. Another scene involves the Bride talking to one of Bill's old colleagues in order to find out where Bill is located. This scene drags on terribly and gives the viewer pointless information on this character which again has precisely no bearing on the movie at all. The only scene which is worthy of inclusion is the obligatory training scene. This is a direct homage to many old Kung Fu movies, right down to the beard stroking sensei. But even this goes on unnecessarily and has you shifting uncomfortably in your seat. And although this scene ties in with the finale and burial scenes, it only serves to remind you that, whilst the Bride was seemingly unable to master punching her fist through a piece of wood, she was apparently highly enough thought of by Pai Mei (the sensei) that he taught her the ""hand of death"" trick which he had previously never taught to anyone. Hmmm.The action sequences are brief and entirely unsatisfying for a movie based around the concept of revenge. Bud isn't even slain by the Bride, but by Elle using a Black Mamba (we know it's a Black Mamba because, as Bud is writhing in his death throes on the floor, Elle gives us a tedious five minute exposition on the snake). Elle isn't killed by the Bride, but rather maimed and left after a fight that was very scrappy and not at all elegant. And finally Bill, who is killed by the Bride (after endless boring dialogue about superheroes) in one of the most anticlimactic and disappointing ""final encounter"" scenes I've ever witnessed.The truth of this movie is that it's really not a movie at all. It's the extra half-hour that they had to cut from the first film, padded out to two hours or so to make a sequel. With not even particularly brutal editing, KB2 could be distilled down into 30 minutes of relevant, interesting scenes and tacked on to KB1 to make that movie complete. Otherwise this bloated monstrosity is doomed to obscurity in the way that so many sequels so often are - due to over hype and audience expectations being too high.Quentin Tarantino is to be commended for his movie efforts on the most part. However, KB2 is little more than self-indulgent twaddle wrapped up as a film and served up for consumption on the strength of its predecessor. It's destined to become one of those ""I liked so-and-so, but the sequel was rubbish"" type of deals. This is even more certain in the light of certain comments I read by Tarantino where he made a big deal of telling everyone that he was sparing no effort in the editing room. If this film is an example of his editing skills, I'd say he needs to be evicted from post-production facilities and the door locked securely behind him to ensure he can't get back in.",Rob_Taylor30,April/2004,1," Kill Bill?

Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) - IMDb,"I'm going to be honest about this: I like unabashedly violent action films. I'm 42 years old, I'm from Texas and I can take it. Growing up with films like 'Rambo', 'Die Hard', 'The Terminator' and 'Robocop', I can't stand that watered-down ""no-blood-no-swearing"" gutless kiddie fare that is being served as ""action"" these days. I know the real thing when I see it - we used to see it all the time back in the day - and I hardly ever see it anymore.Which brings me to this movie. 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was being shown just around the corner from where I live, and because I loved two of director Matthew Vaughn's previous films, 'Layer Cake' and 'Kick-Ass', I naturally took the chance to see it. I had already read some comments from previous screenings that this film was totally bad-ass, and I can now say that's actually putting it mildly. This film is nothing short of bat-shît crazy.Years ago Tarantino said in an interview that he had written a James Bond script and that he would love to direct a Bond film. Sadly, that never happened, but ever since I read that I wondered what an R-rated Bond might be like. I don't know, maybe Matthew Vaughn has read that interview too and saw the potential, because 'Kingsman' is pretty much that: An ultra violent, funny, crazy, foul-mouthed James Bond film (with a little bit of 'Men in Black' and 'Mission Impossible' thrown in). You could say that this is to Bond what 'Game of Thrones' is to 'Lord of the Rings': Where the former can't and dare not go (for marketing and box office reasons), the latter joyfully and gloriously ventures. Dirty and (very black) humor - check. Bad language - check. Gratuitous violence - check. Needless to say, I was thrilled.But it's also a fantastic action film with an amazing cast (Oscar winners Colin Firth and Michael Caine, plus Sam Jackson AND Mark Hamill) and spectacular, over-the-top fight-scenes that in some instances even rival films like 'The Raid' for their sheer visceral intensity. In short, if you're as fed up with lame wannabe Die-Hards and Terminators as I am, go watch this film. Apart from the rare 'John Wick' or 'Equalizer', 'Kingsman' seems to be pretty much the only antidote to the toothless, generic tripe Hollywood tries to pass for action these days. 9 stars for the film and the story, 11 stars for the balls to pull this off the way they did. Average = a perfect 10.EDIT:P.S. I recently stumbled upon an article on the importance of R rated movies.

Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) - IMDb,"I went into this movie with decent hopes given the high rating it had, but it's not like I was over expecting or anything. In the end I found this thing a total a mess. I think for me it tried to ride too many lines and as a result failed in most aspects. It tried to take itself serious as a spy movie, yet it also tried to be this weird comedy, and while I think movies are capable of doing both, this one just didn't do it well or right to the point where it just bounced me out of the movie completely. Far as it taking itself seriously I found it to be way over the top unbelievable and unrealistic to the point of being stupid. Far as the comedy, I just didn't think the nuclear head explosions or the McDonalds being served on a silver platter was funny at all.Granted I'm American and I get that English humor is a bit different, but I love Monty Python, Snatch, Mr. Bean, even most of the Bond films. Yet most of the funny moments in this movie I just found remarkably unfunny to the point where rather than it being a quick laugh it just completely bounced me out of the movie. And the few comical moments that were actually funny were already covered in the trailers, so for me this movie totally fell flat on the comedy scale to the point of actually hurting the movie.Now on the taking itself seriously aspect, the whole spy gig, the young recruit, it just failed on that level for me as well. Certain aspects of the action scenes were done well and some of the bullet time action was good, but I thought the editing needed a lot of work. The massacre in the church I just thought was way over done and too long. I find it amazing in movies like this how fight scenes go on for many minutes and when it's all done, people are barely winded, breathing normally. Give me a break, go watch professional boxers or MMA fighters and see how they look after just one round, and they are real athletes who train vigorously. So while some of the action was okay, it was so over the top that again it bounced me out of the movie. So between the bad comedy and overcooked action I was constantly being reminded that I was watching a movie rather than be swept up into one.My last beef is with the main kid and the whole ""recruitment / training camp"". Probably what bounced me out of the movie the most was here we have some reckless rebellious kid who's training to this point has been gymnastics, so okay he's flexible, has good balance, etc... Yet with little to no further training at all he's the biggest bad ass? The recruitment / initiation program was a joke. It wasn't a training program of any kind, it was basically ""lets throw these kids in a no win situation and see how the fend and who comes out on top."" I get the idea was they were trying to weed through all the recruits to get the best one, but the whole while I kept thinking ""So this kid is just a natural born bad ass because he did gymnastics and has daddy issues?"" Then once he's out and starts real life spy work he's untouchable and better than all the worlds master assassins. It's like her Mom's bf who bullies him early in the movie, who he confronts in the end, and I'm thinking ""So other than being this super spy what has he done to actually improve his skills as a fighter?""Overall I thought the action was decent, but very over the edge of what you'd consider to be believable ""movie believability I mean."" The black comedy was pretty flat and did very little in making me laugh or enjoy myself. Finally the believability of this kid taking over for his dad and his quasi predecessor was just absurd. I give it a 3 / 10. One point on principle and because I liked the main spy girl, a 2nd point because some of the action was decent, and a 3rd point for the best part of the movie which was the bare ass scene at the end, which shocked me enough to yell out ""HELLO!""",dcobbimdb26,February/2015,3, Didn't work for me on any level,0,"[go, movie, decent, hope, give, high, rating, like, expect, anything, end, found, thing, total, mess, think, try, ride, many, line, result, fail, aspect, try, take, serious, spy, movie, yet, also, try, weird, comedy, think, movie, capable, one, well, right, point, bounce, movie, completely, far, take, seriously, found, way, top, unbelievable, unrealistic, point, stupid, far, comedy, think, nuclear, head, explosion, mcdonalds, serve, silver, platter, funny, american, get, english, humor, bit, different, love, monty, python, snatch, bean, even, bond, film, yet, funny, moment, movie, found, remarkably, unfunny, point, rather, quick, laugh, completely, bounce, movie, comical, moment, actually, funny, already, cover, trailer, movie, ...]","[i, went, into, this movie, with, decent, hopes given, the high rating it, had, it, is, not, like, i, was, over, expecting, anything, in, the end i, found, thing, total, a mess, i, think, for, me it, tried, to, ride, too many lines, as, a result, failed, in, most, aspects, it, tried, to, take, itself, serious, as, a spy movie, yet, it, also tried, to, be, this weird comedy, while, i, think, movies, are, capable, of, doing, just did not do, it, well, right, to, the point, where, it, just bounced, me, out, of, the movie, completely, far, as, it, taking, itself seriously i, found, it, to, be way, over, top unbelievable and unrealistic, to, the point, of, being, stupid, far, as, the comedy, i, just did not think, the nuclear head explosions, the mcdonalds, being served, on, a silver platter, ...]",154.93054541430604,16.342616419140114,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,0,3,3,1,1,4,1,1,1,0,1,5,0,5.5560975609756085,205,319,went movie decent hopes given high rating like expecting anything end found thing total mess think tried ride many lines result failed aspects tried take serious spy movie yet tried weird comedy think movies capable well right point bounced movie completely far taking seriously found way top unbelievable unrealistic point stupid far comedy think nuclear head explosions mcdonalds served silver platter funny granted american english humor bit different love monty python snatch bean even bond films yet funny moments movie found remarkably unfunny point rather quick laugh completely bounced movie comical moments actually funny already covered trailers movie totally fell flat comedy scale point actually hurting movie taking seriously aspect whole spy gig young recruit failed level well certain aspects action scenes done well bullet time action good thought editing needed lot work massacre church thought way done long amazing movies like fight scenes many minutes done people barely winded breathing normally give break watch professional boxers mma fighters look round real athletes train vigorously action okay top bounced movie bad comedy overcooked action constantly reminded watching movie rather swept last beef main kid whole recruitment training camp probably bounced movie reckless rebellious kid training point gymnastics okay flexible good balance etc yet little training biggest bad ass recruitment initiation program joke training program kind basically lets throw kids win situation fend comes top idea trying weed recruits best whole kept thinking kid natural born bad ass gymnastics daddy issues starts real life spy work untouchable better worlds master assassins like moms bf bullies early movie confronts end thinking super spy done actually improve skills fighter overall thought action decent edge would consider believable movie believability mean black comedy pretty flat little making laugh enjoy finally believability kid taking dad quasi predecessor absurd give 3 10 point principle liked main spy girl 2nd point action decent 3rd point best part movie bare ass scene end shocked enough yell hello,0.10917534722222222,0.4898573908730157,1
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) - IMDb,"Directed and co-written by Shane Black; based on a novel, ""Bodies Are Where You Find Them"" written by Brett Halliday; and starring Robert Downey Jnr, Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan.A terrific opening credit sequence easily sets up the audacity and chagrin of the film for an appreciative audience. In essence, these are the reasons why you need to see this movie: the razor sharp wit, shockingly fast-paced and hysterical dialogue, pulp-fiction-esquire vibe, its pure cheesiness and the cynicism of a beat up old paperback detective novel. Got you yet? Alright, maybe an explanation of the seemingly simple plot is warranted. It begins with a ridiculously funny set up resulting in Downey's character being paired up with Kilmer to observe the latter in his job as a private detective. They hook up with a down-on-her luck actress who brings a case for the sleuths. This synopsis constitutes gross misrepresentation on my part as things get remarkably complex. How so? Well, even the lead the character (who also is purposefully pathetic as narrator) takes time out within the movie to remember where he is in telling the story. There are even snippets of dialogue where the characters attempt to fill in the gaps or actually remind themselves of what has happened thus far in the movie. Downey, Kilmer and Monaghan are all caricatures drawn from popular references of literature, movies and art. All however, are larger than life, exhibit great chemistry and for a movie buff, it is heaven to witness the self referential exercises and hear the narrator shred every narrating convention applicable. Downey's performance is remarkable (neurotic, comic, vulnerable and charming). I have never seen Kilmer in such a well-defined, uproarious piece of work. Monaghan is also integral to the trio and shines exuding a brash, fighting and sexy appeal. She brought back fond memories of early Kathleen Turner and Rene Russo. The fact that her look screams Renee Zellweger, is not a bad thing either. Black became famous in the 1980s for writing the hit buddy movies: Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight. As a first time director, he does well keeping the frenetic pace and allowing the audience to catch up only to get lost time and time again. The style is so disarmingly effective, that at times I shook my head in confusion or found my hands against my mouth, agape in shock. I also think that in creating such a brilliant script that Black may have blacklisted himself in Hollywood for mirroring its supposed fame and glamor and exposing its not too pretty side. His one-liners and connected sub-plots are not typical and Kilmer and Downey make magic with their banter and clinical delivery. All the ingredients of a pulp-noir novella can be found, even employing a structure of chapter-type headings within the movie. Parallel story lines unfold and given plot assumptions are turned over, always with achingly funny results. Even the clichés are clever e.g. a tough guy predictably crashes through a glass table, or body after body turns up, to haunt the characters.I strongly recommend the movie, given the talent of Downey and Kilmer. Downey should be honored with a Lead Actor Oscar nomination; while Kilmer deserves a Supporting Actor nod. It thrilled me to see them both in their element, as I was on the verge of disavowing them as marquee/box-office draws. The screenplay should also attract Oscar consideration.

Knockin' on Heaven's Door (1997) - IMDb,"This movie is not as good as it seems. The story is catchy maybe for 12-year-olds. I watched it in the movie theater at that very age and liked it. Just a few weeks ago i tried to watch it again and it was so terrible, i couldn't even finish it. Knocking on heavens door is full of stereotypes. The two goons, who are hired to get the car back act terribly and fulfill every cliché in the book. Til Schweiger really sucks at trying to be a sensitive macho. And all that talk about getting to the sea sounds like it's part of some low-level chick-flick.I really didn't enjoy a minute of this movie (the second time i watched it).I don't mean to offend anybody who actually watched this movie and liked it i just think that it doesn't deserve a rating 7.6. That would make it as watchable as 'Carlito's Way' (the older one), 'High Fidelity', 'Kontroll' (very good Hungarian movie), just slightly worse than House of the flying daggers' and even better than 'Chasing Amy'. Not that those movies are the best ones ever made. But i think all those movies are better than 'Knocking on Heaven's Door' and don't deserve the same rating. That's why i would give it a 4.

Kubo and the Two Strings (2016) - IMDb,"""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is a hard movie to explain. There is a story in it and the adventure is grand and fun, but I can't place it into a category of traditional storytelling. The themes of the film are the values of memories and how we truly can never forget people that we lose throughout our lifetime. Very mature themes that are handled with such finesse and creativity that I can't say I have seen anything like it before. Even when you as the audience know where the story is headed, the film surprises you with the delivery and you actually grow and learn with the characters. The strength of the film is the pure visceral experience it provides. The visuals and sound had a layer of depth and drama that you feel in your inner core. It is more of an experience than it is a movie that you watch. Throughout the film, I felt moments of sadness, loss, happiness, horror, fear, and accomplishment. It is a movie that truly raises the bar for animation and it saddens me that many people will not check it out as it is very different from traditional animated films that we are used to seeing from other major animation studios. So much care and attention went into this film. The world Laika has created is rich with so much history, story, mythos, and culture that even some movies and series that are much longer can't fully create. I felt that the world is living and that magic is truly alive. I love how the character make it feel special that magic exists, but aren't put of by it, when they see it for themselves and have to question the logic.The characters are fun and lovable, but also brave and dimensional. Not one character felt out of place and they're inclusion felt important. The voice casting is top-notch and I felt like the celebrities actually made an effort. Unlike many big-budget animated productions, The voice actors weren't distracting and added their own layer of charisma that enhanced and drew attention to the characters. Monkey is probably the best character and I feel like she'll be the fan favorite as she's funny, powerful, and a total bada**.Overall, Laika has produced probably their best animated film to date and that is saying a lot from a studio that produces quality efforts time and time again. ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is unlike anything out there and deserves to be seen on the big screen. The animation alone is breathtakingly gorgeous. The beautiful score and music only adds to the complexity of the film. It is probably the best film of 2016 so far and I find it hard to beat.

Kubo and the Two Strings (2016) - IMDb,"I am a pretty big fan of Laika. As a studio, they have brought a blend of stop-motion and CGI into the mainstream and have also tested much riskier subject material than other animation companies. Not only is their animation time consuming and risky, but their ideas are fairly risky as well (in today's market, that is).And Kubo is another interesting premise with beautiful animation, gorgeous backgrounds, and a nice style to it. It looks really good. Props to the animators. Stop-motion is advancing further and further with every movie Laika is making, and the stuff that is done in this movie would have seemed impossible to do only 7 years ago when Coraline was first released.The first 20 minutes of this movie are excellent and well-told!However, beautiful animation does not make a good movie...Story is the heart of a movie, and if you don't know how to tell a story, then you should go back to the drawing board (or storyboard). The biggest issue with Kubo isn't the most obvious one. The characters are nice, the animation is nice, the action is nice, and everything feels pretty solid, but what really kills this movie is the editing, the script, and its lack of solidity. In short: Kubo and the Two Strings doesn't know what it is.I could write a 10 page essay on the deeper issues of this movie, but that doesn't fit in one IMDb review. In Kubo, and lot of interesting ideas are brought up, but none of them fit together or are cohesive. For example, what is Kubo's motivation? Staying alive? Saving his mom? Beating his grandpa? Kubo never really gets true motivation until the third act and this is a major issue for the movie. The movie says Kubo is on an adventure, but he doesn't seem to feel the stakes until the final act, which is way too late in the game for us to care about him.The same goes with the villain. The background and motives of the villain are constantly changing and inconsistent. One second he wants to kill Kubo. Next second he wants his eye. Yet another second later, he just wants to help Kubo come to heaven with him. Then he hates everyone becomes they are human. Then his motives change to he just hates human because they could overthrow him. Then another motive where it is because he thinks they are disgrace.THIS IS A BIG ISSUE.For the villain's motivation and reasoning to be completely ambiguous and confusing completely ruins Kubo's arc... which is equally confusing and muddled. Essentially, both the villain and the protagonist are the weakest points of this movie. A movie can't really hold together with this big of a problem. And this issue is repeated throughout the movie where nothing is actually fully realized. For example: there is one scene where Kubo briefly loses control of his powers and it does something he didn't mean to do. Never mentioned again in the movie.The plot of his mother being sick and needing to be taken care of. Never fully explained or fully realized.Why the mom can't recognize her own husband when she sees his face? Why does the mom pretend she isn't kubo's mom (she says it is so he won't feel bad?!?!?). How come the mom told stories of the locations of all of the MacGuffins, but then doesn't know where they are?What did the moon king want with Kubo's eyes? Why does the moon king have Kubo's eye at the end when he is a human, but not when he is a spirit being? Why does the moon king become a human? Why does the town lie about his past? Why did Kubo trust the moon king in the dream, when his whole journey is to beat the moon king, but then when he sees the moon king he trusts him?*big spoilers* Why is there a red paper samurai? Why is there a red paper samurai once the beetle shows up, who is the actual real-life version of that samurai! Why didn't anyone recognize the beetle as the father, especially when the father's samurai armor appears to be sitting within that same cave? Why didn't anyone follow the red paper samurai to the last location of the armor? They followed it the entire time, but not at the end?Long story short, this list of character problems and inconsistencies is much longer than this, but a lot of these are pretty big plot problems and not just nit-picks. The finale of the movie is problem the worst element of the movie and not because it isn't visually stunning, but mostly because it is one character who has no tangible motivation versus someone else who hasn't had a very clear goal throughout the film. To make it worse, the movie doesn't even know what it is about. Is it about memories? Is it about death? Is it about stuck-up snobs? Is it an attack on tradition? Is it attacking perfectionists? What is the movie about? What makes this all the more frustrating is the fact that ParaNorman is a movie that has a similar premise, but it does it perfectly. The ending of ParaNorman works, because all of its themes tie together flawlessly. ParaNorman is a cohesive story and knows what it is saying. Kubo does not.Sadly, if you are expecting the next Coraline or ParaNorman, then prepare to be disappointed. This movie feels like a first-pass. A lot of ideas, but none of them mesh together or are completed.",FairlyAnonymous21,August/2016,5, Interesting premise that doesn't know how to be told,0,"[pretty, big, fan, laika, studio, brought,

Kung Fu Panda (2008) - IMDb,"I really wasn't expecting much, other than a few laughs, which would have been OK for a Dreamworks animation movie. But KUNG FU PANDA exceeded all expectations. The story is simple but the execution is superb. It would be really difficult to find something to improve on the production. The voice-overs are really good, esp Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. The animation is very rich and the colors are crisp and bright. The action sequences are breath-taking. The laughs are mixed in at the appropriate moments.

Lady Snowblood (1973) - IMDb,"Like many of you, Id never heard the title Lady Snowblood before Kill Bill came out, so when I watched Kill Bill and saw Tarantino mention this film as one of his biggest influences, well I knew I would have to check it out sooner or later. So did Tarantino really rip off this flick or what? You bet your double edged sword he did! The story is about this couple who get mugged by these four thugs. The husbands gets the ax by the killers and the wife gets raped by all of them many times. When the lady kills one of the killers and slays him she ends up in jail pregnant with a bastard child. When the child is born the mother dies, but not before whispering into the childs ear that her only purpose in life will be to kill those who were responsible for the death of her family. That little girl is raised by a Kung Fu master and ends up being Lady Snowblood. A creature living only to avenge those who murdered her entire family.I wont say Tarantino isn't a genius on his own right the guy is one of my favorites, but when he gets inspired he sure knows where to get his inspiration from! There's many images lifted right off from this movie. Lets see the most notable of all rip offs is Oren Ishii who is no doubt molded after Lady Snowblood herself. Right down to her underground gangster deals and her ugly past. Right down to wanting to avenge her parents deaths. She chops heads and slices and dices like she means it! Blood sprays out in huge amounts in the same way that it sprays in Kill Bill, as if you just opened a sprinkler system to water your lawn. There's the four or five people that she has to kill which pop up in her mind every time she sees them, exactly the same way as in Kill Bill. And I mean exactly the same way, all four bad guys looking down at the camera as if the camera was on the floor! Lady Snowblood has a list of people she has to kill, I mean the similarities are astounding. But still, it didn't really bother me since I was enjoying this damn movie so much! The story is what really pulls you in. Its a fantastically woven revenge film to the Nth degree! I mean the level of hatred thats transferred onto Lady Snowblood when she is a child and the horrible things that happen to her spawn one of the most hatred filled characters that I have seen in a long time. Just like Beatrix Kiddo, Lady Snowblood (aka Yuki Kashima) stops at no ones plea of mercy. She executes her revenge no matter what circumstances have occurred or changed from the time of her parents death. Basically its a you did it now you pay for it kind of story. But with some wonderful characters and complications along the way.There were many excellent things about this movie but the most pivotal of all was the flawless direction brought on by Toshiya Fujita. I mean this movie was like ahead of its time or something. Or maybe thats just the way movies were made in the seventies and it raised to such cool levels in a natural way. But this film has all these visual gags and tricks that could have only been spawned from that glorious era known as the 70s. Many scenes show that this director took special care in making this movie special, like those scenes with Lady Snowblood walking in the snow with her dress filled with the blood of her victim.So even though this movie gets pretty gory and violent, visually Id say its very elegant. The music is also incredibly good, mixing traditional Asian music with this great theme song that Tarantino took from this very movie and placed it in his. The song adds an incredible emotion to the film, specially when you know what it says. Also of special notice is the movies excellent performances! From the whole cast we get nothing but credibility and sincerity in the acting. There's an excellent scene in which Yukis mother is giving birth and dying at the same time and the dialog and performance she gives was really something! If there's something I have to say that I didn't like its that the blood looked too red and too liquid. I mean, I know blood is liquid but not like water. Blood is thick and sticky and on this movie the blood looks a cartoonish red and flows like water which rested a couple of notches of credibility. But thats really nothing, the film is damn near perfect for me. Also don't go in expecting a Kung Fu movie cause this isn't a Kung Fu movie its a revenge movie. Don't get me wrong, there's swordplay involved and lots of violence. Decapitations, bodies split in half, hands cut off. But not necessarily any Kung Fu fights involved. So, lots of gore and slicing and dicing, but no Kung Fu.In conclusion, a very very kick ass film. This is were Kill Bill was born and Kill Bill was as good as it was because it was already ripping off an truly excellent film. So, yeah, Id say go out of your freaking way to get this movie as soon as you can and enjoy one of the coolest revenge films to come out of Asian cinema. Lady Snowblood will get revenge on you if you don't!

Lethal Weapon (1987) - IMDb,"Lethal Weapon is a nearly perfectly structured action movie. The acting, the story, the script, the directing, even the IDEA of the movie all combine to make up a fascinating and thrill-packed police film. The cross-cutting at the beginning of the film was particularly effective, in my opinion, as Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are introduced. The startling difference between their separate lives provides for tons of fun to be had later in the movie. Roger starts his day off as the family man reluctantly celebrating his 50th birthday party with his numerous children and his loving wife in the big family house, while Riggs is shown waking up naked in his trashy trailer and beginning his day with a healthy breakfast of a cigarette and a beer. The fact that both Roger and Riggs hated that they had to work together was especially effective in creating a touching atmosphere as they grew to be closer and closer friends. They worked so well together in this movie; it was a symbiotic relationship. It was almost like they fed off of each other, and kept each other in line and out of trouble. I also liked the way that they showed that Riggs was deeply angered when he learned that the bad guys had taken Murtaugh's daughter. Things like this, when done right, can really get you to sit up and really get into the movie, and it was definitely done right here. Riggs was also very amusing in his anxiousness about being a cop (`Why don't you let me go to sleep?' `No, come on, we gotta get up and catch bad guys!'), and Gary Busey delivers an excellent performance as the lead bad guy. This is the type of role that he plays best (see ""Under Siege"").
Although the violence was painfully present in some parts (the torture scenes were short but extremely difficult to watch), the film never relied on violence to pull it along or keep the audience's attention. The story was sufficient enough so that there was no overindulgence necessary in anything like that. In this film you see the first of the now traditional Lethal Weapon scenes in which Riggs and Murtaugh stagger away from a smoking crime scene, seeming to hold each other up. The final fight scene between Riggs and Mr. Joshua (Busey) was a little excessive, and there were a few scenes which were a bit faulty (how did the guy on the building ledge expect to kill himself when there was such a huge air bag inflated on the ground directly below him?), but overall this was a spectacular crime thriller. The movie rushes along at a feverish pace, and particularly Gibson's and Glover's success working together on screen make this a timeless action film that is not to be missed.",Anonymous_Maxine12,November/2000,9, This is the classic action film that introduces one of the best action duos ever to come to the big screen.,1,"[lethal, weapon, nearly, perfectly, structure, action, movie, act, story, script, direct, even, idea, movie, combine, make, fascinate, police, film, begin, film, particularly, effective, opinion, martin, riggs, mel, gibson, roger, murtaugh, danny, glover, introduce, startle, difference, separate, life, provides, ton, fun, later, movie, roger, start, day, family, man, reluctantly, celebrate, birthday, party, numerous, child, love, wife, big, family, house, riggs, show, wake, naked, trashy, trailer, begin, day, healthy, breakfast, cigarette, beer, fact, roger, riggs, hat, work, together, especially, effective, create, touch, atmosphere, grow, closer, closer, friend, work, well, together, movie, symbiotic, relationship, almost, like, fed, kept, line, trouble, also, like, way, ...]","[lethal weapon, is, nearly perfectly structured, action movie, the acting, the story, the script, the directing, even, the idea, of, movie, combine, to, make, up, fascinating and, thrill-packed police film, the cross-cutting, at, the beginning, of, the film, was, particularly effective, in, my opinion, as, martin riggs, mel, gibson, roger murtaugh, danny glover, are introduced, the startling difference, between, their separate lives, provides, for, tons, of, fun, to, be had, later, in, the movie, roger, starts, his day, off as, the family man, reluctantly celebrating, his 50th birthday party, with, his numerous children, his, loving wife, in, the big family house, while, riggs, is shown waking, up, naked, in, his trashy trailer, beginning, his day, with, a healthy breakfast, of, a cigarette, a beer, the fact, that, both roger, riggs, hated, that, they, had, to, work together was, especially effective, in, creating, a touching atmosphere, as, they, grew, to, be, closer and, closer friends, they, worked, so well together, in, this movie, ...]",67.80059783292336,-9.22064035294931,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,3,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.960893854748603,179,232,lethal weapon nearly perfectly structured action movie acting story script directing even idea movie combine fascinating thrill packed police film cross cutting beginning film particularly effective opinion martin riggs mel gibson roger murtaugh danny glover introduced startling difference separate lives provides tons fun later movie roger starts day family man reluctantly celebrating 50th birthday party numerous children loving wife big family house riggs shown waking naked trashy trailer beginning day healthy breakfast cigarette beer fact roger riggs hated work together especially effective creating touching atmosphere grew closer closer friends worked well together movie symbiotic relationship almost like fed kept line trouble liked way showed riggs deeply angered learned bad guys taken murtaughs daughter things like done right really sit really movie definitely done right riggs amusing anxiousness cop let sleep got ta catch bad guys gary busey delivers excellent performance lead bad guy type role plays best siege although violence painfully present parts torture scenes short extremely difficult watch film never relied violence pull along keep audiences attention story sufficient enough overindulgence necessary anything like film first traditional lethal weapon scenes riggs murtaugh stagger away smoking crime scene seeming hold final fight scene riggs joshua busey little excessive scenes bit faulty guy building ledge expect kill huge air bag inflated ground directly overall spectacular crime thriller movie rushes along feverish pace particularly gibsons glovers success working together screen timeless action film missed,0.10613459669582122,0.5334305150631681,1
Lethal Weapon (1987) - IMDb,"Plot: One police officer with suicidal tendencies and his close-to-retirement colleague have to uncover a huge drug-smuggling operation and at the same time cope with each other.You'll love Lethal Gun if: You like these macho, cop-duo over the top action films of the 80's and don't really care about getting you intelligence insulted. Honestly I rented this movie just to help myself remember why I liked it when I was very young and I can't say I figured out why. However if you can handle the movie's cheesiness, unrealistic situations and characters and the stereotypes of US cop films, you're in for one of the best of its kind at least that's what the majority says. The saving grace of the film: the great chemistry between Danny Glover and Mel Gibson and while when I was younger I loved the psycho bad-ass Mel Gibson, I can see now that Glover not only plays a much, much better character but also a more realistic one thus easier to relate to, (unless you are 8 years old).You'll hate Lethal Gun if: You hate these unrealistic cop films and if you want a movie with an actually interesting plot. Honestly what's the big deal with this movie and its -far worse- sequels? They are one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot is pretty typical nothing will leave you with your mouth open or surprise you. The characters are of cardboard quality at best, with Gibson playing a cartoon who is more irritating than cool. Glover plays the conservative family man, (with a moustache of course!), and Gibson is the rebel cop who cries at night while trying to kill his self because his wife died in a traffic accident boooohoooooo! Riiiiiight The action sequences are boring and the way the main characters and especially Gibson behave is unrealistic and far from heroic more like suicidal just for the fun of it. You want a good cop movie look elsewhere. Yes, I've seen worse but the point here is that this movie is one of the most successful ones!!!FINAL VERDICT: A Series Of Action Movie Clichés (4.4/10)[+] Great main character chemistry.[-] Boring action sequences and plot.

Logan (2017) - IMDb,"I look at ""Logan"" as the ""Alien 3"" of the X-Men franchise. It basically gives a gigantic middle finger to everything that came before it. It destroys everything the movie that proceeded it (""Days of Future Past"") accomplished. In ""DOFP"", all of mutant kind are about to be destroyed, but by the heroic actions of Logan himself, they survive. Then, according to the film ""Logan"", they all get killed off a few years later anyways. It has been said that one of the big themes of ""Logan"" was disappointment. I agree. I was very disappointed in this film.""Logan"" is annoyingly low on information. We are thrown into this terribly depressing future without a whole lot of explaining as to how we got here. As I watched, I kept waiting for a scene where things were laid down for the audience. It never came. The best we got were a few vague references here and there. There was something called ""The Westchester Incident"", but the reference was so fleeting that I barely caught it. There was also another part near the end where the main villain claims that he had something to do with the lack of new mutants being born and that he is Striker's son? I think? It wasn't very clear plus the dude's last name wasn't actually Striker, which further confused the issue. Later on, I hopped online and had a few things clarified (such as the ""Westchester Incident""), but why weren't they clearer in the film in the first place?Another issue I have with this film is how it treats the deaths of its two main characters. First, with Xavier, he is stabbed unceremoniously by a clone of Logan about two-thirds the way through the movie. There are no heroics in this death, no greater purpose, no meaning. He's just stabbed and then dies. What a disservice to such an incredible and important character to this franchise. Then there is Logan's death. Logan is impaled by a chunk of wood from a dead tree. The dude literally has a skeleton made out of adamantium, which is the world's most indestructible metal, but yet wood cuts right through it. What? Now, we are shown through the film that Logan is sick and his ability to heal is getting worse, but that shouldn't affect his crazy metal ribcage! They even go to great lengths to explain that the only thing that can really kill him is an adamantium bullet, but in the end a hunk of wood does just as well.Then there is the ""R"" rating. Once again, if this were a true stand-alone movie and not part of a larger narrative, I'd mostly be OK with it. But of course it isn't. Everything that we got with the ""R"" rating was unnecessary. What we got was far more blood and gore (there was more than one decapitation), a dump truck full of f-bombs and even one scene where a woman in a bridal shower flashed her boobs. All of this could have been edited out and the film would have been fine.Don't get me wrong, I am no prude. I've seen plenty of violent movies, heard plenty of f- bombs and seen plenty of nakedness on film. I'm fine with it, but it has to be there for a good reason. I didn't see a whole lot of good reason here. What really did it for me, though, was seeing a 10-11 year old girl running around slashing off people's body parts. That got to be a bit much for my taste and I began to wonder for whom that kind of stuff didn't bother? Once again, does our society have a bit of a violence fetish, one that has gotten so bad that watching children tear people to shreds is OK? I think the reason for the rating has more to do with a popular trend in movies (especially comic book movies) nowadays than it does with serving this particular story. With the success of ""Deadpool"" last year, film studios realized that an R-rated super hero film is not only possible, but profitable. But as Malcolm hinted at in the movie ""Jurassic Park"", just because you CAN do a thing doesn't mean that you SHOULD. For ""Deadpool"" it works. You can't do ""Deadpool"" without all that R-rated stuff. That is who ""Deadpool"" is and that's fine. With Wolverine, however, he's already been established throughout the previous 8 X-Men films. All of these R-rated ""upgrades"" now don't make a whole lot of sense.When I read positive reviews for this film, the main point that is made is how good the dramatic performances are, especially from the two leads, Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman. In this case, I completely agree. They did a fantastic job. Even the little girl was amazing, I thought. That can be quite a rarity when you think about how hit and miss child actors are. However, even though most of the performances here are top notch, great performances do not a great film make. If the story sucks, what does it matter? It is hard for me to imagine why Patrick Stewart or Hugh Jackman would be excited to work on a project like ""Logan"" once they read the script. Were they excited to basically negate all of the great work they did (and others did) in the previous X-Men films? They, better than anyone else, should understand what this whole series has been about since the beginning. Yes, ""Logan"" is unique and absolutely gave these actors something different to do with their characters. And yes, they gave stellar performances. However, there needs to be at least a little bit of respect for the source material (and its fans) than this. Much like the season premier of ""The Walking Dead"" this past fall, this seemed more like a kick in the pants for viewers than anything else.",jherrick-6-99133610,March/2017,4,

Lost in Space (1998) - IMDb,"I don't think Lost in Space was a bad movie. Is it a movie to be honored the all-time best? No, it's not. There are flaws in this movie, but I don't care too much. The movie is about a family, the Robinsons trying to go to the other habitable planet in the galaxy. They do all right until the villain, Spider Smith tries to kill the family and he ruins the navigational system. Now the Robinsons are lost. The acting is OK. Some of the actors did a great job such as Matt LeBlanc and Gary Oldman. The rest did OK. The special effects are not as good as movies from the time period such as Armageddon or Godzilla. The effects are good, though. I was disappointed in the writing. Akiva Goldsman is a respected writer with talent. For a bad script, all the actors did a good job. The music is pretty good.

Lost in Space (1998) - IMDb,"William Hurt and Mimi Rogers are two of the most wooden actors, as is only too apparent in this film.  The script, plot, dialogue were all awful -- silly and contrived.  The effects were okay, except for that amazingly phony monkey thing.  Worst of all, there was no sense that anyone was enjoying themselves in making this movie.  They could have gone over the top, had some fun with the idea of re-making what was a pretty cheesy show in its original form, but they were all stone-faced and serious.  I can't believe 80 million was spent on this tripe.  I bemoan the current trend of movies that use expensive, intricate special effects with no good writing to back it up.

Léon: The Professional (1994) - IMDb,"Luc Besson's movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler.  Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package.  Jean Reno plays a character named  Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a ""cleaner"", or hit-man.  His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant.  Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role.  Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.Jean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about.  Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her.  Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope.  He moves the story along by his actions.  Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.The Professional is what movie-making is all about.  Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie.  Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates.  The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie.

Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) - IMDb,"When I wrote this review 3 years ago I had no idea how many people hate this movie and they are preferring Mad Max 3 over this film. Claming Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the third film is better film than this, really? Better than this? Listen folks it has no Mel Gibson so what? So what's your point? Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn't interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road. I was entertained and I enjoy it. At least it wasn't so sick like was Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max: Fury Road is my second favorite film in the franchise and this movie did it right and it correct that third film that it failed been an good action film. Like it or hate it, is your problem but in my opinion it is a good action violent movie and I love it to death I am an action junkie myself. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is my number 1 favorite film of all time. I think Mad Max: Fury Road is George Miller's masterpiece. Finally, Finally after 30.years of fiasco Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome that completely destroyed the Mad Max Trilogy, George Miller finally come back and fix the mistake he did 30.years ago. Why wouldn't I love this film? This film is the best one in the series along side Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior at least for me it is the best film. It has action, high explosive and Tom Hardy been a real Mad Max unlike Mel Gibson was in Thunderdome. I am happy they made the 4th movie. Tom Hardy was a bad ass Mad Max. I didn't even noticed that we don't have Mel Gibson in here. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. I love high speed and pursuit on a road which I seriously love this. The thing was more similar to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior but much better, George Miller fix it, the film did not copy The Road Warrior the film has it is own story. All, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Immortan Joe was a fantastic villain in here he was really good. The film shows a real wasteland and the future which I am really happy about it. NOTE: ""Don't waste your time if you have seen the original."" from a hater review my reply: Yes I will waste my time watching this awesome action flick! Yes I have seen the Original Film Mad Max with Mel Gibson so many times than you ever did! I love this film much more than Mad Max because sometimes the original is very boring and the film has so much Drama in it and less Action than it is in Fury Road. I wanted to have an apocalyptic action film like are Fury Road and The Road Warrior which this film fix it. Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015 and It is finally the finest blockbuster of 2015! Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 post-apocalyptic action film directed and produced by George Miller, and written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. The fourth installment in the Mad Max franchise, it is an Australian and American venture produced by Kennedy Miller Mitchell, RatPac-Dune Entertainment and Village Roadshow Pictures.

Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) - IMDb,"It's hard to believe that the same talented director who made the influential cult action classic The Road Warrior had anything to do with this disaster.Road Warrior was raw, gritty, violent and uncompromising, and this movie is the exact opposite. It's like Road Warrior for kids who need constant action in their movies.This is the movie. The good guys get into a fight with the bad guys, outrun them, they break down in their vehicle and fix it. Rinse and repeat. The second half of the movie is the first half again just done faster.The Road Warrior may have been a simple premise but it made you feel something, even with it's opening narration before any action was even shown. And the supporting characters were given just enough time for each of them to be likable or relatable.In this movie there is absolutely nothing and no one to care about. We're supposed to care about the characters because... well we should. George Miller just wants us to, and in one of the most cringe worthy moments Charlize Theron's character breaks down while dramatic music plays to try desperately to make us care.Tom Hardy is pathetic as Max. One of the dullest leading men I've seen in a long time. There's not one single moment throughout the entire movie where he comes anywhere near reaching the same level of charisma Mel Gibson did in the role. Gibson made more of an impression just eating a tin of dog food. I'm still confused as to what accent Hardy was even trying to do.I was amazed that Max has now become a cartoon character as well. Gibson's Max was a semi-realistic tough guy who hurt, bled, and nearly died several times. Now he survives car crashes and tornadoes with ease? In the previous movies, fuel and guns and bullets were rare. Not anymore. It doesn't even seem Post-Apocalyptic. There's no sense of desperation anymore and everything is too glossy looking. And the main villain's super model looking wives with their perfect skin are about as convincing as apocalyptic survivors as Hardy's Australian accent is. They're so boring and one-dimensional, George Miller could have combined them all into one character and you wouldn't miss anyone.Some of the green screen is very obvious and fake looking, and the CGI sandstorm is laughably bad. It wouldn't look out of place in a Pixar movie. In the previous movies, there was occasionally a sped up frame rate that gave a nice homage to the silent era.

Madras Cafe (2013) - IMDb,"Review of MADRAS CAFE *** This café serves a fantastic exceptional 'espionage thriller' ***. There is no spoon feeding in narration. So, Be alert. & when they starts to serve on screen,be ready to fill mind's cup with all the thrilling elements.WHAT'S GOOD :-  Script & screenplay  Fast & furious pace  Awesome blend of history & fiction  Under played characters, not a single actor went overboard.  Twist & Turns at right time, with right amount.  Well shot scenes, real treatment. WHAT'S BAD :- BAD, This word does not exist in Shoojit Sarcar's vocab. Yahaan, Vicky Donor, Madras Café. All the three films prove it.LOO BREAK :- Yes, there is a tiny moment,the so called 'Interval' for that.Use it,if u feel like. SCRIPT ANALYSIS :- script writers--'Shubhendu Bhattacharya & Somnath Dey'. Dialogue -'Juhi Chaturvedi'.The movie, which is set against the backdrop of Sri Lankan civil war, revolves around the serious subject of terrorism and shows how the characters are caught in the political turmoil. In this movie, a important piece from the war history of India & neighborhood is taken, which is then mixed or blended with fiction to give it a shape of script. And what an amazing mixture, it turns out. In the first half, a buildup/set up is provided for the upcoming events regarding war's violence, political conspiracies, disguised investigation, emotional sacrifices, betrayal and assassination. Lots of things unfold in this part at a smooth pace, in context of film. So, go with flow. Don't let yourself, get behind. Because 2nd half is just simply awesome. Due to the fantastic set up provided in 'before interval session', Interesting & gripping Events unfold and follow each other at a very rapid speed in this post interval part, which is most important spice to make a thriller. Some great things needs special mention like, whole things are done without any sort of melodrama. Correctors and situations are written and kept very real, which keeps the audience engaged till the end. Dialogues gives a good support to showcase the intensity of situations and language is used for different correctors by keeping in mind the background of those correctors.Overall, this is a superbly written, well researched, out of box type script. Which presents a new genre and awesome entertainment without compromising on quality.PERFORMANCES :- John Abraham, An actor is tried to present in this movie by Shoojit and john grabbed this chance with both hands. He is fully into his corrector of an Army investigation officer, who is appointed by the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in the War Zone. he has kept his tone down and underplayed it, which works in context of movie's real setting. Nargis Fakhri is playing a war correspondent. Whatever screen space is given to her, She has done good job. She has sort of re-discovered herself as an actor after a near miss performance in 'rock star'. Siddartha Basu as R.A.W Head is fitted to the bill and comes out with a good performance. Rashi Khanna as John's wife looks graceful and gives a caring wife role full justice. Prakash Belawade, who plays John's superior Bala, is a delight to watch. Gestures and Restlessness as demanded by his corrector, is totally reflected on the screen. Great work.MUSIC:-'Shantanu Moitra'. There are no songs in the movie as such,everything is played in the background. And in that department Shantanu passed with flying colors. Superb job in background score. Special mention:- Real bullets use in sync sound leaves an incredible impact, it does bring authenticity to the film.EDITING:-'Chandrashekhar Prajapati'. This man has done mind blowing job. For a thriller one ingredient is must, pace. He has given it. Every cut, every frame looks apt for the movie. Not a single scene feels forcefully kept. super work.DIRECTION:-'Shoojit Sarcar'. He is a game changer, that's confirmed. If there was any 2nd thought regarding that, in any mind. This movie is going to clear it. What a direction, just awesome work. His movie has touched always out of box zones, Madras Cafe is not behind. Although this movie has a theme like real war backdrop & deals with some historical incidents. And playing with history is like playing with fire, because if it gives u edge, it can burn the whole project too (if does not come right). But this critical and intense theme is well handled by the director. he has brought out great performances from his acting team and has pulled off a very difficult film. Job well done sir. Canvas of this movie looks international, and credit for that goes to Shoojit sir and to one more person, Kamaljeet Negi(director of photography), Shoojit's vision has been superbly captured by him, which is visible on the silver screen. Great camera-work. VERDICT:- Well, it's almost a home run. A great thriller backed by a killer script. Sure shot A game changer. As real, as it can get. Yup,Giving 'MADRAS CAFE' 9 out of 10. This movie is not a regular spicy potboiler. Don't expect over the top action, big dialogues. If u like to watch real hard hitting cinema, go visit this CAFE.

Madras Cafe (2013) - IMDb,"I'm a stranger to Indian cinema, other than being familiar with the usual clichés of Bollywood-style song, dance and drama.I read some reviews here, recommending this movie, and calling it a genuine political thriller. Well, it is. Sort of.It's hard to describe what I feel is wrong with the movie. The plot is believable, and you want to see more. Not being intimately familiar with the horrible history of the Tamils, and having read only scattered articles here and there, I did not have any way to determine whether the movie was true to facts or not, and for this I apologize.So, what's wrong? Well, it feels like there is an entire plot here. There is. But it feels like someone sat down, wrote a list of ""what makes western political thrillers good"", came up with 10-12 key scenes, and made those. Without really bothering too much with tying them together. It feels not so much rushed as uncohesive. And that's a shame, because ..The visuals are nothing short of stunning. Excellent camera-work, glorious colors, scenery, and almost worth watching for this alone.But ultimately, for me, the story is where the substance is. And in this one - perhaps this is due to me being unfamiliar with Indian cinema - it just feels cut to pieces and abrupt. Key events just ""happen"" from one scene to the next, and if you want to keep up with who's who, and who's pulling what strings, don't blink for a second.Given that I don't know the material intimately, like I would with say a WWII movie, or a typical cold-war spy movie, and the actors were all unfamiliar to me, this movie was hard to follow. Perhaps for a more local audience, it would be infinitely more enjoyable.

Man on Fire (2004) - IMDb,"I was very eager to see this one when I read the synopsis and knew who was involved. After making Revenge and True Romance Tony Scott became one of my favorite directors of the 90's. Add Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken with a hard boiled script by Brian Helgeland and you think you've got a masterpiece on your hands.But it's not.

Max Steel (2016) - IMDb,"I actually enjoyed this. After reading a few reviews I expected it to be really slow and boring but was pleasantly surprised. Sure it took a little longer going places than some of the rushed non-stop explosion fests available but that's why I liked it. It felt like it was it's own film and not just a carbon copy of all other superhero style films out there, it actually took time to build a sense of mystery and develop the characters rather than just rushing from one plot point to the next.I felt like I got to know the main character and was intrigued to see more of the movie universe unlike many forgettable action/sci-fi movies out there.If you go into the film expecting non-stop action sequences go watch the avengers, if you want something with a little mystery and gradual exploration of that mystery watch this",squaffle6,January/2017,7, Not as bad as reviews imply.

Max Steel (2016) - IMDb,"Make no mistake, Max Steel, the Mattel toy property, turned Cartoon Network staple, turned full length movie has become the worst reviewed wide-release film of 2016. After a single weekend, the movie has garnered a staggering Metascore of 26, and a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. Those are scores usually reserved for direct to DVD video game adaptations and the occasional Pauly Shore movie. I'll admit with so many metrics stacked up against it, my interest both as a critic and a connoisseur of junk cinema was piqued. I wanted to hate this movie; I came in with the expectation that this movie was a special kind of crappy. But alas it's just the regular kind of crappy.The plot of Max Steel promises the adventures of a middle-America teenager named Max (played by perennial kids-TV bit-player Ben Winchell) and his alien companion named Steel. Due to Max's seemingly inexplicable ability to conjure energy on a molecular level, Steel acts as a symbiotic techno-parasite consuming it with relative safety. In return, Steel (voiced by Josh Brener) enhances Max's physical abilities and protects him with a laser spewing bio- tech suit. Little does Max know that his new friendship with his alien buddy upsets a certain celestial balance, that holds the future of our world in the hands of a sinister enemy.The plot promises these things but in an election year, we should all be wary of false promises by now. While watching Max Steel I was less concerned about the fate of the world than the fate of those involved in this project and made the mistake of taking it seriously. The film co-stars award nominated actors Maria Bello and Andy Garcia whose natural gravitas threatens to give Max Steel more weight than your average Smallville (2001-2011) knockoff. I understand that veteran actors need to eat but most actors should draw the line when asked to put on a half-assembled Power Rangers outfit.The film itself is a cheap, shabby, impotent mess that tries oh so hard to ape the grungy self-serious aesthetic from recent superhero fare. But instead of finding a balance between pretension and moment- focused excess, the camera diddles through colorless scenes that look like they were shot through a layer of cellophane and Vaseline. This of course is when we get exteriors of antique pickup trucks chugging through amber-waved back-roads. When it comes to the heavy climaxes, the movie seems poised to give us the same blighted industrial zones we've seen in everything from low-budget horror movies to late-period Steven Seagal flicks. Only this time it's lighted like a neighborhood Zap- Zone to give the film's target audience (mainly toddlers and their misguided gamgams) the desire to whip out their video games.It's all so genuinely and quite unpleasantly sad to see a movie like Max Steel. Watching bloated, intelligence insulting, big-budget fare fall flat can give anyone a sudden jolt of schadenfreude. Yet watching something whose only real crime is being too big for its britches, well it's just not that much fun. The film and its makers are trying to mimic a certain style, a certain flow, a certain spirit yet it simply have none of the right tools to do so. So they patched this puppy up with as much exposition, flashbacks and Josh Brener inspired wisecracks to trick you into thinking it was all worth it. But it's not, it's really, really not.Max Steel is like going to the zoo, visiting the tiger exhibit and seeing a tiger born and raised in captivity. Many people arguably worked their best on this film, but because their best is inspired by the limited cultural echo chamber of comic books, blockbuster movies and Halo, we get a movie that lazes about, the fierceness in its eyes completely absent.",bkrauser-81-31106416,October/2016,3, Yikes What a Piece,0,"[make, mistake, max, steel, mattel, toy, property, turn, cartoon, network, staple, turn, full, length, movie, become, bad, review, film, single, weekend, movie, garner, stagger, metascore, rotten, tomato, score, usually, reserve, direct, dvd, video, game, adaptation, occasional, pauly, shore, movie, admit, many, metric, stack, interest, critic, connoisseur, junk, cinema, pique, want, hate, movie, come, expectation, movie, special, kind, crappy, ala, regular, kind, plot, max, steel, promise, adventure, teenager, name, max, played, perennial, ben, winchell, alien, companion, name, steel, due, max, seemingly, inexplicable, ability, conjure, energy, molecular, level, steel, act, symbiotic, consume, relative, safety, return, steel, voiced, josh, brener, enhances, max, physical, ...]","[make, no mistake, max steel, the mattel toy property, turned, cartoon network staple, turned, full length movie, has become, worst reviewed, wide-release film, of, after, a single weekend, the movie, has garnered, a staggering metascore, of, on, rotten tomatoes, those are scores, usually reserved, for, direct, to, dvd, video game adaptations and the occasional pauly shore movie, i, will admit, with, so many metrics, stacked, up against, it, my, interest, both as, a critic, a connoisseur, of, junk cinema, was piqued, i, wanted, to, hate, this movie, i, came, in with, the expectation, that, this movie, was, a special kind, of, crappy, it, is, just, the regular kind, of, crappy.the plot, of, max steel, promises, the adventures, of, a middle-america teenager, named, max, played, by, perennial kids-tv bit-player ben winchell, his, alien companion, named, steel, due, to, max, seemingly inexplicable ability, to, conjure, energy, on, a molecular level, steel acts, as, a symbiotic techno-parasite consuming it, with, relative safety, in, return, steel, voiced, by, josh brener, enhances, max, ...]",255.84885892979491,-32.60111599026832,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,1,2,1,4,2,3,1,0,1,2,0,5.777408637873754,301,377,mistake max steel mattel toy property turned cartoon network staple turned full length movie become worst reviewed wide release film 2016 single weekend movie garnered staggering metascore 26 0 rotten tomatoes scores usually reserved direct dvd video game adaptations occasional pauly shore movie admit many metrics stacked interest critic connoisseur junk cinema piqued wanted hate movie came expectation movie special kind crappy alas regular kind crappy plot max steel promises adventures middle america teenager named max played perennial kids tv bit player ben winchell alien companion named steel due maxs seemingly inexplicable ability conjure energy molecular level steel acts symbiotic techno parasite consuming relative safety return steel voiced josh brener enhances maxs physical abilities protects laser spewing bio tech suit little max know new friendship alien buddy upsets certain celestial balance holds future world hands sinister enemy plot promises things election year wary false promises watching max steel less concerned fate world fate involved project made mistake taking seriously film co stars award nominated actors maria bello andy garcia whose natural gravitas threatens give max steel weight average smallville 2001 2011 knockoff understand veteran actors need eat actors draw line asked put half assembled power rangers outfit film cheap shabby impotent mess tries oh hard ape grungy self serious aesthetic recent superhero fare instead finding balance pretension moment focused excess camera diddles colorless scenes look like shot layer cellophane vaseline course exteriors antique pickup trucks chugging amber waved roads comes heavy climaxes movie seems poised give us blighted industrial zones seen everything low budget horror movies late period steven seagal flicks time lighted like neighborhood zap zone give films target audience mainly toddlers misguided gamgams desire whip video games genuinely quite unpleasantly sad movie like max steel watching bloated intelligence insulting big budget fare fall flat give anyone sudden jolt schadenfreude yet watching something whose real crime big britches well much fun film makers trying mimic certain style certain flow certain spirit yet simply none right tools patched puppy much exposition flashbacks josh brener inspired wisecracks trick thinking worth really really max steel like going zoo visiting tiger exhibit seeing tiger born raised captivity many people arguably worked best film best inspired limited cultural echo chamber comic books blockbuster movies halo movie lazes fierceness eyes completely absent,-0.009333239224543556,0.440552684030945,0

Mersal (2017) - IMDb,"I went in for the USA Premiere Show (FDFS) For The Much-Awaited Action Entertainer MERSAL. Oh god, the crowd was unbelievable!

His Triple Role : Farmer, Doctor, Magician were all new get ups for Vijay and has he done well with these characters? 100% YES! Right From The ""Mersal Arasan"" To The Flashback Sequences Of The Leader Farmer, Thalapathy excels! As Usual, he excels in his romance, dance, comedy and attitudes throughout the film which keep the audience entertained in each way. The Story by Baahubali Writer ""Vijayendra Prasad"" was quite different even though it had some elements of an action Marsala film but Atlee's direction of the film keep it unique.AR Rahman's BGM is merattal masss! He proves his Oscar winning award in Mersal, songs such as Aalaporaan Thamizhan and Neethanae bring out the audience a real taste of Mersal!SJ Surya as a villain plays his role neatly (look out for his dialogues/scenes in the second half) a perfect suit for the movie - Stylish.Also, actors such as Vadivelu and Sathyaraj stand out not just for their comedy but for their highly rated emotional scenes which Atlee narrates well. Vadivelu fanatics will leave the cinema with smiles on their faces:)Heroines play their role superbly in each of Vijays Characters and so do other actors such as Sathyan, Kovai Sarala, Vikram Vedha's ""Cheta"" etc.GK Vishnu has fantastic cinematography for a debut, thanks to Atlee for giving him an opportunity to see how perfectly he can do his job! Visuals in Aalaporaan Thamizhan and Many of the magician scenes excel, thalapathy is captured spot on!Ruben the editor has done his job well, with neat cuts and editing to keep the movie at a smooth pace.What can I say, a pure Thalapathy Vijay entertainer with high emotional/ mass scenes which will impress the audience of all type.

Miss Congeniality 2: Armed & Fabulous (2005) - IMDb,"I saw this at a special screening and was very pleasantly surprised. I'm not usually a huge fan of sequels, but this for what it is, is incredibly entertaining on its own merit. I love Sandra, so that may be one of the reasons I liked as much as I did, but that being said, the rest of the cast makes this without a doubt one, of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.

Miss Congeniality 2: Armed & Fabulous (2005) - IMDb,"""Miss Congeniality"" was a very funny and entertaining light romantic comedy that delivered funny moments because of it's creative plot and of course, the sexy-funny performance of the always talented Sandra Bullock. Heck, Sandra delivers one of the best moments in cinematic history when she walks with that tight mini dress in slow motion... God I love women.But this sequel is a total mess with a clichéd plot, predictable situations, and not so funny characters. The addition of Regina King as a sidekick for Sandra Bullock worked most of the time but it wasn't vital to make the movie work.The situations are not funny at all and it truly made me think I was watching an episode of ..I don't know, any standard sitcom.But the best thing about the movie is Sandra Bullock's performance. She's always funny, SEXY, smart. She's the perfect franchise actress that can save the day ANYTIME.

Mr. India (1987) - IMDb,"This Classic from the eighties is one of the few sci fi films to be produced in India incidentally it is also one of the best. Directed by shekhar kapur of ""Elizabeth"" fame Mr India is one of his earlier works. The cinematography may not be great but the rest sure is! An interesting and intelligent story that makes for full on family entertainment. This movie will make you smile laugh and cry and bring out all the other various emotions in you. Sridevi players the bubbly cheerful news reporter and Anil kapoor the Super Hero who upon discovering the invisibility formula sets out to avenge the worlds evils. Aka Mogambo played by the greatest villain ever to grace the Indian screen Amrish puri. His mogambo still strikes terror into the hearts of kids. Anil Kapoor & Sridevi's relationship is more of a homage to the Louis lane Clark Kent type relationship seen in several superhero movies. The rain and wind dance number by sridevi. could easily give the new crop of actresses a run for their money. brilliantly acted and executed her dance with the invisible man is simply unforgettable and who can forget her cheeky ""hava hawi"" number. you can watch this film time and time again and not get bored.

Nayak: The Real Hero (2001) - IMDb,"The director has done a good job with this movie. It is thought-provoking and inspirational. The plot is along the lines of ""What if I were the President or the Prime Minister of the country for a day"" essays that we have all written in our school days. Not only does it expose corruption in various aspects of life (which is not really new) but it also offers genuine solutions in tackling those problems. There are enough twists in the plot to keep you glued to your seat. I was disappointed with Rani Mukherjee's role which is insignificant and restricted to singing songs with the ""Hero"".

Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion (1997) - IMDb,"Finally, after long last, I have managed to watch the End of Evangelion. It was worth any wait.  Those not familiar with the series will have no clue what's happening, so you should at least watch the first 24 episodes.  End of Eva takes place as an alternative to the last 25 and 26th episodes.  It may sound confusing, but trust me, if you just sit back and enjoy the ride, everything makes sense...even if not right away.The final Angel has been killed.  The 'hero' of the story, Shinji Ikari, now regrets doing it, as he was the only person who seemed to ever like him for who he was.  But there is no time to lament on personal demons, as the shadowy puppet masters in SEELE have set the final stage of their plan in motion.The dreaded Third Impact.  What's even more surprising is that the entire series shows one, giant plan to actually SPEED ALONG the Third Impact, as it could lead Humanity to it's next evolutionary step.  And so, Humanity will now rely on a weak savior who may or may not lead humanity to it's oblivion.  A hero who must first fight his own inner dragons, and come to terms with life, and love from himself and from others. As a response to the public outcry that the last 2 episodes were someone strange and had no ""Mecha Combat"", the End of Eva has enough of both combat, AND philosophical scenes.  A strange, but wonderful mix. 
Asuka's fight against 9 Evas is absolutely the most STUNNING visual fight sequence I have ever seen.  The energy and awesome scope of the battle is impossible to convey through words alone.Though Asuka's character is as flawed as Shinji's, she finds redemption in this movie.  Again, an amazing testimony of the Human Spirit and our will to live.  The emotional impact of this movie is also quite amazing.  It brings reality and the mind to question, and asks us if being individuals is better than being a whole.  Is life just a dream, and can we ever be Gods of our own Reality?  Those who have watched the last two episodes of the series will see instances where the movie and episodes combine and compliment each other. Finally, the animation is wonderful.  Creepy and breathtaking.  Powerfully deep, but also amazing on the physical conflict level as well.  This movie is EASILY a match for Akira and is an instant classic. 
Watch it with an open mind, and be prepared to be stunned. Be ready to question yourself.  Be ready to use your mind in ways you may have not before.

Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion (1997) - IMDb,"End of Evangelion is a film unlike any other, and mostly not in a good way.In short: there are individual bits in End of Evangelion that are very effective, exciting and often horrifyingly disturbing. Yet they're bound together by chunks of nothing, and it gives the film a schizophrenic feel, much like the series. If you start to think, pretty much nothing actually happens in the first half, and when things start to happen during the second half, they do so in a way that will leave most viewers scratching their head and going ""WHAT?""If you were bothered by the constant esoteric and weird dialogue in the series, you're not going to like this. When we are thrust into Shinji's mind in the second half the imagery on-screen truly defies explanation. In short: if you didn't like the last 2 episodes of the series, End of Evangelion has that same stuff and then some. There are multiple scenes where you could arrange the dialogue lines in any order, and it'd make exactly the same amount of sense, i.e. next to none. So much of the film is taken up by either tedious or incomprehensible things that it just doesn't work as a movie.But there are individual parts that work, and oh boy, do they ever! Asuka fighting the mass production Evas, Misato saying goodbye to Shinji and the physical presentation of Third Impact among others are all effective moments, and visually outstanding. It is best to just drown in the visuals and the unique atmosphere than try to figure out anything that is going on. The second half features numerous ""money shots"" that would make excellent movie posters purely on their own. The animation is top-notch, and does the job excellently. The film also has a very unique atmosphere of strangeness and bottomless desperation.Much like the series, I admire the concept of End of Evangelion. There are few films that paint such an effective picture of the apocalypse as this one. But it's constantly bogged down by the same problems as the series: incomprehensibility, pretentiousness and inconsistency. For example: why does SEELE constantly barrage the GeoFront even after having defeated the NERV personnel? My guess: the makers wanted the movie to have explosions.But, I still recommend seeing this film, because it will provoke some sort of (and likely a strong) reaction from anyone, even if it's just shouting ""WHAT the HELL was that about??"" out loud.",tuomas_gimli10,October/2012,5," Visually riveting, but doesn't work as a whole",0,"[end, evangelion, film, unlike, mostly, good, short, individual, bit, end, evangelion, effective, excite, often, horrifyingly, disturb, yet, bound, together, chunk, nothing, give, film, schizophrenic, feel, much, like, series, start, think, pretty, much, nothing, actually, happens, first, half, thing, start, happen, second, half, way, leave, viewer, scratch, head, go, bother, constant, esoteric, weird, dialogue, series, go, like, thrust, shinji, mind, second, half, imagery, truly, defies, explanation, short, like, last, episode, series, end, evangelion, stuff, multiple, scene, could, arrange, dialogue, line, order, would, make, exactly, amount, sense, next, none, much, film, take, either, tedious, incomprehensible, thing, work, individual, part, work, oh, boy, ...]","[end, of, evangelion, is, a film, unlike, any other, mostly not, in, good, short, are, individual bits, in, end, of, evangelion, are, very effective, exciting and often horrifyingly disturbing, yet, they, are bound, together, by, chunks, of, nothing, it, gives, film, a schizophrenic feel, much, like, the series, if, you, start, to, think, pretty much nothing, actually happens, in, the first half, when, things, start, to, happen, during, the second half, they, do, so, in, a way, that will leave, most, viewers, scratching, their head, going, what?""if you, were bothered, by, constant esoteric and, weird dialogue, in, the series, you, are not going, to like, when, we, are, thrust, into, shinji, mind, in, second, half the imagery, on-screen, truly defies, explanation, in, short, if, you, did, not, like, last, 2 episodes, of, the series, end, of, evangelion, has, ...]",29.275805386585866,-6.809972351586904,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,6.269230769230768,156,201,end evangelion film unlike mostly good way short individual bits end evangelion effective exciting often horrifyingly disturbing yet bound together chunks nothing gives film schizophrenic feel much like series start think pretty much nothing actually happens first half things start happen second half way leave viewers scratching head going bothered constant esoteric weird dialogue series going like thrust shinjis mind second half imagery screen truly defies explanation short like last 2 episodes series end evangelion stuff multiple scenes could arrange dialogue lines order would exactly amount sense e next none much film taken either tedious incomprehensible things work movie individual parts work oh boy ever asuka fighting mass production evas misato saying goodbye shinji physical presentation third impact among others effective moments visually outstanding best drown visuals unique atmosphere figure anything going second half features numerous money shots would excellent movie posters purely animation top notch job excellently film unique atmosphere strangeness bottomless desperation much like series admire concept end evangelion films paint effective picture apocalypse constantly bogged problems series incomprehensibility pretentiousness inconsistency example seele constantly barrage geofront even defeated nerv personnel guess makers wanted movie explosions still recommend seeing film provoke sort likely strong reaction anyone even shouting hell loud,0.1591691995947315,0.45392603850050667,1
Ninja Scroll (1993) - IMDb,"Jubei, a rouge samurai who's wandering the land becomes involved unwillingly in the battle between an evil group of supernatural demon warriors known as the Eight Devils of Kimon and the country's government. After a town was wiped out overnight by a plague, so the eight devils could get in to get perform a certain mysterious task. Jubei soon is joined by a poisonous female samurai known as Kagero to find out the Devils' business is in this town, after one of them wipe out her ninja team and nearly her if it hadn't been for Jubei. He also encounters someone of the past, who he thought that he already had killed. So I've gone back to my roots when anime was a childhood favourite of mine, but this one isn't for kids. I loved this flick when I was in my early teens, so watching it now was such a nostalgia trip and surprisingly it still holds up exceptionally well. The popular worldwide hit ""Ninja Scroll"", which was directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri (who brought us the excellent ""Vampire Hunter D"") paves way for a maturely slick, extremely violent and intensely erotic outlook. Everything about it comes thick and fast. It frenetically exploits the blood sprayed violence like a running tap, but still never loses that beautifully tender edge that seeps into many of the situations. The compelling premise isn't a mind-bender, although a bit jaded, but its simple origins only enhance the taut lay out and poignantly dark array of blisteringly out-there conflicts. It's surprising in it developments and you're left amazed by the film's personality and unique world that's created. It vividly captures the period of this atmospheric world. They're such an imaginatively diverse barrage of dynamic characters, with the likes of the rock-build demon to the hunchback whose hump are a wasp nest and a snake lady who can actually shed her skin. This gave it a real eastern mythological state and only proves that the bad guys had the most fun. The story might feel like its there only to set up one spirited confrontation after another and really it is. But the story-telling element is effectively defined, as most of the main players get enough time to mould there own back story and present their significance to where it could be heading. Jubei makes a cool anti-hero and Kagero fits nicely along side him. The skillful animation has class, agility, originality and distinguishing details making its way into these stunningly pristine visuals. An aggressively crisp sounding FX makes the experience a whole lot more impressive with such a wide range and the oriental twang found in the eerily mystic music score makes this presentation more brooding in its blinding passion and checkered emotion. Kawajiri faced no restrictions here, and was free to come up with an illustriously innovative and majestic anime piece that works in every frame. ""Ninja Scroll"" is more highly involving than you would believe.

Oldboy (2003) - IMDb,"To start off; This is the one and only film that kept me quiet for a whole 5 mins after seeing it. I literally couldn't close my mouth, and yet there wasn't any sound coming out of it. Oldboy had such an impact on me that words are too little to describe that impact. Therefore this film is definitely in my top 3 films ever made. It belongs there because it has a massive ingredient that a lot of films seem to miss out on; a divine plot. Even though the acting and screenplay are world class, the plot is really the cherry on the cake.When it comes to screenplay Park Chan-Wook is unique (at least for western standards) in his way of filming. The colours are so vivid and it seems like he wanted every shot to be a piece of art. One tip: If you like the shooting in 'Oldboy', have a look at 'Sympathy for Lady Vengeance', the third part in Park's revenge-trilogy. It's even superior to the camera-work in 'Oldboy'. Don't, however, expect a story like Oldboy's, because you would be very disappointed.When it comes to acting and the music, this film is also one of the better films ever made. The music sticks in your head and every time I put in my Oldboy-DVD and the theme-song comes up, I'm just flooded with good memories (even though the plot doesn't have a single reason to be happy about). The characters are also presented very well by the outstanding cast. Especially Choi Min-Sik and Yu Ji-Tae set a very convincing performance. I really appreciate this film being respected as it should be, by having a place in the top 250. If, however, it was up to me it would be even higher in the ranking. I don't see why films like 'The Usual Suspects' or 'Memento', which are fantastic pieces of film-making and which without a doubt deserve a place in the top 250, are higher in the top 250 than 'Oldboy'. They serve the same cause; a fantastic plot. But those plots can't stand in the shadow or even come close to the plot of 'Oldboy'. The one and only reason is that those two films are better known and from a western production company. If we were all living in Asia, no doubt 'Oldboy' would be in the top 20 of all time. My advice to people who haven't watched this film yet: Go see it! This is definitely a must- see. If you have a weak stomach, pull yourself together and still watch it. Don't be as shallow as a lot of people here tend to be. Look beyond the violence and see the things I mentioned before: world class acting, cinematography, music and last but certainly not least the plot. Once you've opened yourself up you'll find a whole new world of cinema.

Oldboy (2003) - IMDb,"Old Boy sucks! No, wait, let me rephrase that: Old Boy is a stylistically challenging, highly innovative, but ultimately hollow and repugnant exercise in genre film-making. And just to let you know where I'm coming from  'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance' was brilliant; an unforgiving and touching descent into doom. In that movie everything that happened somehow had to. One action triggered the next one and we experienced a vicious circle of violence and revenge. The characters seemed trapped in their situation.In Old Boy our protagonist is also trapped, but you know the story, so I won't tell you again. So he's in this room and there is great sound design and camera work. But once he frees himself, the complications and problems multiply. The plot is at first close to incomprehensible as he stumbles from one situation to another. When the villain explains his schemes at the end and brings enlightenment, I just couldn't care anymore. The intriguing premise is destroyed by the revelation that it's all a contrived revenge plot by the bad guy.And contrived it is. The story only works by inserting endless flashbacks (full of bad pathos) and explanations. To keep the audience interested, we get gruesome scenes of murder, self-mutilation and general mayhem. As others have remarked, these scenes are well done, but serve no greater purpose. It's all a so-what comic extravaganza.Out of 'Old Boy' I got small pleasures and a lot of disappointment, courtesy of one of the most interesting directors working today. I liked (among other things) the infamous hallway scene, the actors, the fight with the bodyguard, the revelation of the Secret and the sequence of Oh Dae-su leaving his bad self behind at the end.

Omkara (2006) - IMDb,"I caught the first screening of Omkara, and I must say that I am astounded. Vishal Bharadwaj had previously carved a niche for himself in the industry, with the likes of Makdee and Maqbool, but Omkara puts him in a league of his own. It is an exquisite work of art, with each person putting in their best. Everyone knows Omkara to be an adaptation of Othello, and I frankly expected Omkara to be just that. At best, I thought it would be Vishal's homage to Shakespeare. I was terribly wrong. Omkara is a poem in itself. Every aspect of the movie has the dedication and tenacity of the director stamped on it (considering he has handled direction, dialogues, screenplay, music, and even sung a song). The beauty of Omkara lies not in its portrayal of Othello, but the fact that it uses Othello as a platform to weave an intricate tale of love, obsession, treachery and tragedy. Yes, Omkara is an adaptation of Othello, but that is not the strength of the movie. The real strength of the movie lies in the performances of all the characters, and the gripping narrative. From the word go, Omkara has you by the crotch (pardon the usage), and lets go only after the last credits have rolled off. Vishal's Omkara (Othello) is the chieftain of a band of outlaws in a semi-lawless rural area in Uttar Pradesh. His brother and right hand man is Langda Tyagi (Iago), named so for his limp. Another prominent figure in this gang is Keshu Firangi(Michael Cassio), the only member to have a college education. Omkara is in love with the bewitchingly beautiful Dolly (Desdemona), and she with him. At her behest, he and his gang interrupt her wedding and bring her to his village. In the village, Langda's wife Indu(Emilia) takes Dolly under her wing, becoming companion and friend. When Omkara appoints Keshu as the youth leader of the gang, Langda (who anticipated the post) feels jealous and overlooked, and seeks revenge by convincing Omkara that Dolly is having an affair with Keshu behind his back. For most part the story is the same as that of Othello, with just the background of each character adapted to suit the Indian temperament. Also, the language used a mix of Hindi and Bhojpuri, which adds to the aesthetics of the movie.Ajay Devgan as Omkara ascends to new heights of emoting, using his eyes to convey so much more than he could ever say. The obsessive lover, the ruthless gang leader, a man eaten up by his inferiority complex and the doubts borne thereof, Ajay lives every moment of his character. Viveik Oberoi is seen after a bit of a hiatus, and does considerably well. As the childlike Keshu, with his boyish grin and charm, you can't help liking him, and feeling sorry for him. Kareena Kapoor has always been an actress to reckon with in my books, since her 'Refugee' 'Chameli', and 'Dev' days, and proves her mettle as the devoted and loving Dolly. Quality work from a largely underrated actress, proving that she's a lot more than the glam girl she often portrays. The surprise of the pack was Bipasha, who does a considerably extended 'special' appearance and ample justice to her role as Billo, Keshu's love interest. Neseeruddin Shah as the overlord Bhaisaab, is a treat to watch. To say anything more would take away from the essence of his performance. Konkana Sen-Sharma as the simple, yet shrewd Indu is brilliance personified. With her natural accent and looks, she suits the role to a T. You instantly see in Indu a strong and loving woman. Be it as Dolly's friend, Lagda's wife, or as a bhabhi to the younger members of the gang, Konkana has the role down pat. Particularly endearing is her 'kheiin', akin to an 'arre'. Each of these actors has portrayed their characters faultlessly, and no other actor could have done them better. Yet they all pale in comparison to Saif Ali Khan, as the cunning, devious, and calculating Langda Tyagi. This man is simply too good an actor. Sly and manipulative, his persona exudes pure evil,without even the stereotype evil laugh. His eyes strike a fear that resonates deep in your soul, and even hours after the movie is over,Langda is the character you keep thinking of, and is easily the pick of the lot. If Saif deserved a National Award for HUM TUM, then an award for this is a no-brainer.Hats off to all the cast and crew members of Omkara, and to Vishal Bharadwaj, for creating this masterpiece of contemporary Hindi cinema.SurajPS- Watch out for the expletives used freely in the movie.

On Deadly Ground (1994) - IMDb,"I really don't know what is so horrible about this film.As of this writing On Deadly Ground is on the IMDb bottom 100: #99 and that is just sad.On Deadly Ground is a very decent film. I admit When I first saw it when it came out I didn't appreciate it but after a recent viewing,that has changed one hundred percent!The movie has got it all!A great story,great action,and one heck of a cast!Look, you have Steven Seagal,R. Lee Ermey,Michael Caine,Joan Chen,John C.

On Deadly Ground (1994) - IMDb,"At the height of his fame Seagal was allowed to direct this monstrosity about evil Texas oil Aegis company polluting Alaska. With no prior experience in directing Steve stampeded his way into this movie with as much subtlety as a brick in the face. Originally called 'Spirit Warrior' and hoping to cast loads of English baddies (among them Anthony Hopkins and Jeremy Irons) the film is a horrid example of far too much creative control given to one man too blinkered by his own agenda to bother giving us anything resembling decent storytelling.There is nothing significant or exceptional about Seagal's direction. Nor is the action very well done. It's cut too lazily and not shot for maximum viewing clarity. But what reeks about the story is that some big oil magnate called Michael Jennings (a completely hammy Michael Caine) wants to build a really shoddy oil rig in Alaska made out of dodgy parts because the rights to the land are about to revert back to the Eskimos after 30 years of non-use. So why wait 30 years to build the bloody thing?Seagal plays Forrest Taft, an oil rig fireman who suddenly develops a conscience and is promptly eliminated from the payroll by way of being blown up. Only he is rescue by the Eskimos and, this is where the film just goes insane, goes on a spiritual journey in which he wrestles bears and turns into eagles and stuff. I mean, what the hell is all that about??? Don't even get me started on the scene where he makes a fully-grown hard-ass redneck cry in a bar full of similar stereotypes when the philosophy touches his soul. Then he gets his old self back together and sets about righting all the wrongs of Aegis Oil and saving the environment by littering it with dead bad guys. Jennings hires a bunch of mercenaries (including R. Lee Ermey and Billy Bob Thornton) to take out Taft but of course they all prove to be useless since Taft is revealed to be an ex-CIA Agent (oh dear God..)Nothing much really happens apart from shooting and dying and Seagal beating up nameless extras. We've seen all of this before and it's no different this time round.I do appreciate his environmentally friendly attitude but it could have made it a little less obvious and campy. Seagal's tacked on speech at the end originally ran for 30 minutes (Jeezuz sufferin') but Warner finally stepped in and said a big no-no. We could have had an Oliver Stone or Insider amount of paranoia and conspiracy but this just ends up as the worst of Seagal's Hollywood movies.",CuriosityKilledShawn17,October/2000,4, Grossly over-indulgent vanity piece,0,"[height, fame, seagal, allow, direct, monstrosity, evil, texas, oil, aegis, company, pollute, alaska, prior, experience, direct, steve, stampede, way, movie, much, subtlety, brick, face, originally, call, warrior, hop, cast, load, english, baddie, among, anthony, hopkins, jeremy, iron, film, horrid, example, far, much, creative, control, give, one, man, blinker, agenda, bother, give, us, anything, resemble, decent, nothing, significant, exceptional, seagal, direction, action, well, do, cut, lazily, shot, maximum, view, clarity, reek, story, big, oil, magnate, call, michael, jennings, completely, hammy, michael, caine, want, build, really, shoddy, oil, rig, alaska, make, dodgy, part, right, land, revert, back, eskimo, year, wait, year, build, ...]","[at, the height, of, his fame seagal, was allowed, to, direct, this monstrosity, about, evil texas, oil aegis, company, polluting, alaska, with, no prior experience, in, directing, steve, stampeded, his way, into, this movie, with as, much subtlety, as, a brick, in, the face, originally called, spirit warrior, hoping, to, cast, loads, of, english baddies, among, them, anthony, hopkins and jeremy irons, the film, is, a horrid example, of, far, too much creative control, given, to, one man, too blinkered, by, his own agenda, to, bother giving, us, anything resembling, decent, storytelling.there is nothing, significant or exceptional, about, seagal, direction, is, the action, very well done, it, is cut, too lazily and, not shot, for, maximum viewing clarity, reeks, about, the story, is, that, some big oil magnate, called, michael jennings, a completely hammy michael caine, wants, to, build, a really shoddy oil rig, in, alaska, made, out of, dodgy parts, because, the rights, to, the land, are about, to, revert, back, to, the eskimos, ...]",93.40516369942672,-24.786375749312025,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,1,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.611650485436893,206,245,height fame seagal allowed direct monstrosity evil texas oil aegis company polluting alaska prior experience directing steve stampeded way movie much subtlety brick face originally called spirit warrior hoping cast loads english baddies among anthony hopkins jeremy irons film horrid example far much creative control given man blinkered agenda bother giving us anything resembling decent storytelling nothing significant exceptional seagals direction action well done cut lazily shot maximum viewing clarity reeks story big oil magnate called michael jennings completely hammy michael caine wants build really shoddy oil rig alaska made dodgy parts rights land revert eskimos 30 years non use wait 30 years build bloody thing seagal plays forrest taft oil rig fireman suddenly develops conscience promptly eliminated payroll way blown rescue eskimos film goes insane goes spiritual journey wrestles bears turns eagles stuff mean hell even started scene makes fully grown hard ass redneck cry bar full similar stereotypes philosophy touches soul gets old self together sets righting wrongs aegis oil saving environment littering dead bad guys jennings hires bunch mercenaries including r lee ermey billy bob thornton take taft course prove useless since taft revealed ex cia agent oh dear god nothing much really happens apart shooting dying seagal beating nameless extras seen different time round appreciate environmentally friendly attitude could made little less obvious campy seagals tacked speech end originally ran 30 minutes jeezuz sufferin warner finally stepped said big could oliver stone insider amount paranoia conspiracy ends worst seagals hollywood movies,-0.07621951219512194,0.5314024390243902,0
Ong-bak 3 (2010) - IMDb,"Picking up directly where we last left off in that cliffhanger ending in Part 2 after an opening credits montage to quickly jog our memory, we see how Tien gets systematically broken down by the many minions of his nemesis Lord Rajasena (Sarunyoo Wongkrachang). Here's where I think the Thai audience have the last laugh with their recent censor ratings. Ong Bak 3 is rating an 18+ there, and over here, we got by with an NC16. Not so bad I thought to myself, until the first 5 minutes saw a number of badly executed butchering of the film, that I balked. We should have gone M18 to be in line, and perhaps those torture scenes would have survived the censors scissors. But no thanks to the distributors who decided to try and make this film appeal to a larger Jaa audience. Surprisingly though the more violent moments later on in the film were left untouched, scenes that I felt were violent enough with the likes of a decapitation, and face/head stomp to warrant an axe under the NC16 rating. But I guess I'm not a censor.Anyway, action fans may feel a little bit disappointed with this installment which ran just over 90 minutes. For the first hour we only have limited battle sequences involving our hero, so savour whatever you can in his fight for survival against hordes of weapon wielding enemies who have the unfair advantage of strength in numbers against a badly beaten (just came off those numerous fights from Ong Bak 2) Tien. Totally broken and just as he's about to be executed, Tien gets saved by the bell and brought back to the village of Kana Khone, where another fight ensues involving his new rescuers against Rajasena's assassins.Then it's a good plod onto the hour mark, where Tien goes through a reincarnation of sorts, involving body wraps, mystical chants, Master Bua (Nirut Sirichanya) turning to monkhood and imparting pearls of wisdom, the rehabilitation of body, mind and soul, time for romance with Pim (Primorata Dejudom) his pillar of strength, discussions of karmic philosophy and the circle of life. Tien has to unlearn what he has learnt, and basically has to snap all the bones of his body back in place before he can practice martial arts again, which brings us a bearded Jaa and a training montage in a tree, under water, showing off a lean though scarred body, and is that a little paunch I see as well?So while Tien takes a breather of sorts for his transformation, the duty of keeping the action junkies entertained fell on Dan Chupong's shoulders, as his very short supporting role as the Crow Ghost got expanded here, with his motivation fully revealed. His character soars to evil heights here, taking over the mantle as chief villain, and allowing Chupong to reintroduce himself as an action star to be reckoned with in his own right. Those who have seen Born to Fight and Dynamite Warrior will know what he is capable of, and I really salute him for daring to take on a negative role just to spar with Jaa on screen.But what a letdown when they finally get together to do battle. Overall I found their sparring quite weak compared to what had been done earlier in the film involving other exponents, and the finishing blow was quite a letdown. Already the number of fights and spars here were limited to begin with, one even involving the architecture of the mind (sorry, Inception still fresh), and this one just didn't pack enough oomph. It's built up to be something like Tien being a Moses to lead his people, captive by the Crow to be slaves getting constantly whipped, back to their promised land, and hey, he even comes with a staff that got dropped off after a magical moment got executed, in time for fisticuffs.The only positive coming out from this new Tien, is his new fighting ability. Tien is now more graceful, thanks to the fusion of dance to his moves, and the many moments when this parallel that dance brings to the table, got heavy emphasis, meshing what we usually think of as effeminate, to giving that suppleness to the more masculine moves involving elbows and knees to bone-crunching effect. This to-the-point moves were not forgotten of course, and come in the form of very economical, sometimes comical, but always simple, strikes involving forearms and a rigid body trained to be as hard as steel. I still miss those drunken fists moves from the earlier film, and the insanely choreographed finale battles then, which this one had tried to emulate, only to be a pale shadow of its former's glory.Comedian Petchtai Wongkamiao provided some comic relief in a film that took itself quite seriously, and I think in light of some of the themes that were handled in quite a verbose manner, this was much appreciated. Ong Bak 3 straddles martial arts and philosophy very openly and tried to strike a fair balance between the two, but alas it came off as quite a schizophrenic film very much like True Legend in spirit. I hope the Ong Bak 2 and 3 episodes don't tank Tony Jaa's career, because I'm sure he has enough in reserve to wow audiences once again, should the right story come along that pushes his physical boundaries.",DICK,STEEL22/July,6, A Nutshell Review: Ong Bak 3,1,"[pick, directly, last, left, cliffhanger, end, part, opening, credit, montage, quickly, jog, memory, see, tien, get, systematically,

Ong-bak 3 (2010) - IMDb,"Pretty much everything I have to say is already out there in different reviews, but I'm going to say it anyway. The acting is bad, the dialogue atrocious and the storyline confusing. This I wouldn't care for, if they hadn't spent so much bloody time on it.

Only the Brave (2017) - IMDb,"""Only the Brave"" (2017 release; 133 min.) brings the story if the Granite Mountain Hot Shots fire squad. As the movie opens, ""Based on True Events"" we are reminded, we get to know Eric Marsh and his gang, as they are trying to get certified as Hot Shots, allowing them to combat wild fires in the front line. We also get to know Brendan, a doped-out loser whose girlfriend just got pregnant. Realizing he needs to turn his life around, Brendan applies to join the fire squad and for reasons unknown until much later in the movie, Eric decides to give Brendan a shot. In a parallel story, we also get to know Eric;s wife Amanda, a horse whisperer. But not all is well in their marriage... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from up-and-coming director Joseph Kosinski, who previously directed ""Ton: Legacy"" and ""Oblivion"". In his latest, he steers away from sci-fi and instead brings us the incredible story of the Prescott, AZ wild fire squad, nicknamed the Granite Mountain Hot Shots. I expected a disaster movie, and there is certainly that too, but the movie does much more than that: it brings the story of a group of people in a way that you are completely emotionally invested in those people, and you CARE. Kosinski directs an all-star cast, headed by Josh Brolin as Eric. Is it just me, but Brolin only seems to get better as he is getting older. That guy is just solid and authentic. Miles Teller plays the role of Brendan, an unlikable character at first. Jennifer Connelly is outstanding as Eric's wife Amanda. Taylor Kitsch is one of the guys in the fire squad. In much smaller roles, Jeff Bridges is Duane (Eric's superior), and the ageless Andie MacDowell plays Duane's wife. The movie's photography is eye-candy, and the wild fire scenes, which I imagine are mostly CGI, look very real to me. Last but not least, there is a very nice musical score, courtesy of composer Joseph Trapanese (who has worked with Kosinski before).""Only the Brave"" opened wide this weekend, and I was really looking forward to seeing it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended only so-so (less than half a fairly small theater), somewhat to my surprise, given the stellar critical acclaim this movie has been getting. I can only speak for myself, but I found this to be an outstanding wild fire disaster movie that packs an emotional wallop I didn't expect.

Outcast (2014) - IMDb,"This film attracted me with the role of Nicolas Cage, however, he is not the main character and his role in the film is not quite interesting. This film is simply a Chinese movie with some new winds from western crusaders. However, it is meaningless, the makers tried to attract us with this image but they failed to connect the stories, so it becomes boring.

Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran (2018) - IMDb,"It's a shame that I really had almost no idea about the event it's based on. That very event changed the world's perspective towards our nation and it was indeed a proud moment for us all. PARMANU: THE STORY OF POKHRAN is a mindblowing film. It not only stays true to the event but also makes sure that those who didn't know about it would be able to experience it in a stylish way.PARMANU is a very tightly scripted film. There are thrills, drama and some cool action. Everything is balanced so perfectly that I felt it couldn't get any better than this. There's almost no flaw to find and the lack of musical numbers ensures that a wider audience embraces the film. There are no commercial compromises, and the director has mixed all the elements perfectly to give you a touching patriotic story which proves that unsung heroes can be remembered and honoured on any day. John Abraham is fabulous in this film. He plays a different kind of role and impresses totally, especially in the climax and an action sequence in the second half. Well, I didn't really need to say that since we all know that he's an action hero. This time, he doesn't really play one, but still reminds us of the excellence with which he has mastered this genre. Boman Irani is extraordinary: give him any role and he's gonna play it his way, the perfect way. Diana Penty is impressive and her character is neatly written. Rest of the cast does a splendid job.The review would be incomplete without praising the film's director, Abhishek Sharma whose skilful direction has helped the film become what it became: A perfect entertainer and thought-provoking historical action drama/thriller which also allows for some natural humour to breathe in.Enough of the bashing by critics. This film is awesome and is capable to entertain all ages. PARMANU: THE STORY OF POKHRAN is much more than just a history lesson: it's a phenomenal historical saga which realizes its strengths and thus chooses to remain totally realistic.

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) - IMDb,"I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children's movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can't take such movies too seriously, can one?And so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney ""adventure"" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect?And then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...I cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen ""Pirates"" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, ""Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?""And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?I am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb?I often don't even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.Except for this year.Go Jack.And, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge-podge of loosely- connected ""money shots"" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-heartedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, ""You'd best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you're in one!"" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck-swabbing. And then there's the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey.And now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking ""overproduced by"" credit on the cover-liner. ""Bombastic."" ""Overdone."" ""Absurdly Stupendous.""Well, perhaps it is, for those who spend their lives evaluating such things. To me, it is absolutely transporting. I first listened to it while doing a work-out on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance. It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine.Once again, the children were wondering, ""What's up with Daddy? Is he OK?""Perhaps I am just losing my grip, having an adolescent movie get to me this way. But when those final credits roll, and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says, ""Now, bring me that horizon. Drink up me hearties, yo ho"" and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has.At this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater, lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end, and bid good-bye to the little monkey once more, wiping tears of exultation from my eyes.This is not just another ""entry"" in the summer blockbust sweepstakes. It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness, a true classic, on the order of ""The Wizard of Oz."" I do hope Depp's performance garners not just awards, but a place in the pantheon, something we old fogies -- and our gently fogeying children decades hence -- will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure.

Postal (2007) - IMDb,"Disclaimer: Let me start by saying that I was neither drunk nor high when I watched this movie. I watched it stone cold sober, alone, in my living room.Amazingly I just gave an Uwe Boll film 8 stars, I know, I can't believe it myself. If I were twelve years old and still read MAD Magazine I'd probably have given it ten stars.There are plenty of ""zany"" pop culture riffing movies out there, (Meet the Spartans, Super Hero Movie, Date Movie, etc.) but the difference here is Postal works. I laughed throughout the entire movie, with the exception of about seven jokes which didn't make sense or just didn't work. But it doesn't matter that these seven jokes failed because the movie is an endless stream of jokes, sight gags, bikini clad cult members, machine gun battles, and bad taste in the vein of John Waters/Troma Films earliest efforts.It's too bad Uwe Boll got himself involved in a petty internet pi**ing contest over this film. I think had he just been modest, kept his mouth shut, and let the film speak for itself it may have been a minor success. The old Hollywood saying about there being ""no such thing as bad publicity"" doesn't work for you when all you get is BAD PUBLICITY. That said, the only real problems with the film are the low budget production values and a few of the minor performances, but even those problems just add to the humor of this film. The plot actually made sense.The actors played it straight without being too zany too often. And the jokes, although in bad taste and definitely not for everybody, were never so mean spirited that I was turned off by them.I think Uwe Boll knew what he was doing with this picture.

Postal (2007) - IMDb,"Uwe Boll's best Movie. Better than ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"". Neither of those statements are saying particularly much, but to say the least, this movie is actually worth watching. Postal is essentially an absurdist farce comprised of characters designed to be caricatures of the worst parts of humanity. Assuming this was not some cosmic coincidence whereby Uwe Boll managed to write and direct a movie that actually entertains it's alleged target audience, I feel confident in saying that this movie actually hits it's mark. Knowing the spirit and tone of the source material, this is actually a pretty decent video game adaptation. The movie is essentially a Bollian journey into Tromaville territory: from the crass socio-political commentary, through the excessive violence, coarse language, gratuitous full frontal Dave Foley nudity, right down to the self deprecating director cameo. It's intentionally offensive to everyone. Despite itself, on some level this movie works.

Primeval (2007) - IMDb,"I admit it, I have a soft spot for monster movies. Maybe it's the kid in me who watched all the old ""creature features"" at a young age, or maybe it's the fact that no one has really made a serious monster movie since...well, you tell me. That being said, ""Primeval"" is no work of genius, and like most mainstream films, is loaded with clichéd moments that we've seen in better movies. However, when compared to the films that pass for horror today, this one has surprising bite (no pun intended) at certain moments. The main complaint here seems to be the misleading advertising campaign of the film, hyping it up as a tale of serial killer in rural Africa. Of course, the actual story details an American news team (the brooding male leader, the hot female sidekick, and of course, the token black guy who serves mostly as comic relief) traveling to the war-torn Burundi to film and hopefully capture Gustave, an enormous crocodile who has eaten hundreds of people. Naturally, things go wrong, and the river soon runs red. An interesting aspect of the movie is the inclusion of a warlord in the plot, adding a second threat to the protagonists (Gustave is, of course, their first threat). This risky move sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, but I applaud the filmmakers for trying something new at least. What really redeems the film however are a few key scenes that are surprisingly atmospheric (something most modern horror films have forgotten), well edited, and increasingly suspenseful. Without giving too much away, the croc itself is better than one may expect from this kind of a movie. The cast does what they can with a strictly average script, yet for the most part, manage to elicit some interest and sympathy. The final act is a bit of a disappointment, but by that point, it's already been a fun, exciting ride, and one doesn't really care. In short, ""Primeval"" is strictly what many of us go to the movies for: popcorn entertainment. I myself had originally gone to see ""Pan's Labyrinth"" but as the shows were sold out, my friends and I eventually decided to give ""Primeval"" a go. I wasn't dazzled, but then again, I wasn't expecting to be. It's simply fun, escapist entertainment, and despite what any film snob will tell you, there's nothing wrong with that.

Primeval (2007) - IMDb,"This movie seems to suffer from a low budget. The writing is okay. The plotting was okay. The actors are okay. The special effects are weak. All could have been better. This movie could be compared to Anaconda, but replace the snake with a killer crocodile. Swap out South America and see Africa instead. Unlike Anaconda, Primeval makes a social statement about the political unrest in Africa. In the back drop of filming a crocodile documentary, political unrest and murder is happening all around them. Where this movie suffers is the pacing. It starts out slow and isn't even interesting until the crocodile appears. Once the crocodile appears, that's really all you may care to see. Unfortunately, the special effects are too obvious and the crocodile acts fake and looks fake. It's only at this point that the movie even gets up to the quality of Anaconda which also had fake looking effects.Orlando Jones as Steven Johnson brings a welcome light touch of humor to an otherwise serious movie.

Ra.One (2011) - IMDb,"From the time that the credits roll on to the screen (Thanks to Shahenshah Amitabh, Superstar Rajnikanth and hugs to Sanjay Dutt & Priyanka Chopra), one gets the feeling that the movie is an indulgence in the exercise of 'I scratch your back and you scratch mine' and not the self proclaimed revolution in Hindi film making.It is a confused mishmash of the same formulae that have been used in the Hindi film industry for all these years with some early 90s style Hollywood special effects thrown in. Somebody needs to tell the director Anubhav Sinha and the producer/actor Shah Rukh Khan that one cannot and should not try to please all the people in the audience, else the end result is exactly what they served: a movie that feels forced and staleStory: By now, all who are remotely interested in this movie know about the story. It is the weakest link in the entire setup. The entire writer's union (even SRK has been credited with contributing to something that amounts to nothing) couldn't decide whether this needs to be a sci-fi, superhero, romance, children or an action flick. Some of the outstanding moments (scenes where I nearly stood outside the theater)are: 1. A press conference at the start where the audience is dumb as it believes the crap that Ms. Reddy dishes out about technology 2. The moment when the antagonist steps out of the game - no explanation on how the game developed an intelligence on its own or how it could move into the physical world in a suit that obviously does not have even a millionth of the processing power or storage capacity needed for such a complicated being to function 3. The superhero's entry - again, no idea how it came into being in the physical world. And how the hell did Ms. Reddy (who seems more like a marketing executive) figure out what the lead game designer / team leader SRK could not4. How was Kareena able to keep her husband's death a secret from the neighbours in India? These days when even a burp is reported on the Facebook and/or Tweeted around the world, it seems highly unlikely5.

The story inspired from Judgement Day (robot saves mother and son from another robot), The Last Action Hero (characters from imaginary world stepping out into the real world), Tron (gaming world characters vs real world characters), Kalicharan (father dies, someone replaces him to protect family), Iron Man (the concept of H.A.R.T. is the same as the arc reactor), Millennium Man (a robot learning about emotions) 3. Scenes inspired from Spiderman series, Batman series, Terminator series, Iron Man series, Rajni's Robot, whew 4.

Raazi (2018) - IMDb,"Raazi does what very few Bollywood movies do right. It pulls off a tight script with good acting, and a realistic believable storyline that leaves you on the edge of your seat for two hours. The film also manages to maintain a tight pace while building up towards an impactful climax. In particular, I think three things made it unforgettable: Firstly, the acting was on point, and made the movie what it turned out to be. Alia Bhatt is turning out to be an absolute genius, and has come a long way from her 'student of the year' days. There are very few in her peer-group that can do justice to these kinds of roles. Vicky Kaushal was good as the beguiled husband, and his restrained yet emotional male character (supporting a powerful female lead) is a Bollywood rarity, and was thoroughly enjoyable. The others are on point too, with minor actors like Jaideep Ahlawat and Rajit Kapoor delivering strong performances. Secondly, the movie turned out to be tight and on point, with no melodramatic displays of emotion or sappy songs. The good old premises of a bride departing to her husband's household for (presumably) good, the arranged marriage with a virtually unknown man, and eventual marriage consummation were all present, in theory. These are all typically perfect opportunities to inject unnecessary bridal parting songs, lengthy wedding song and dance sequences (boy's side, girl's side, etc.) and the worst of all - a song balancing sleaze with ""Indian culture"" (read: censor board mandated restraint) that plays when the marriage is consummated (this is typically a couple kissing and rolling around in a bed, carefully clothing their privates with velvet or satin sheets). But Raazi eliminates all of this fluff and more, leaving you wishing more movies would do away with the crap in favor of keeping the pace of the plot. Lastly, and most importantly, Raazi does justice to the complexity of the India-Pakistan conflict. The countries have a shared history which makes the war painfully more unique (e.g. Abdul, the oldest and most faithful caretaker in the Pakistani household is of Indian origin). The movie takes no sides, and shows you that humanity and ruthlessness exist on both sides. This is a significant departure from the patriotic films of yesteryear - we are habituated to seeing a good vs evil theme, and having Pakistanis depicted as soulless warmongers. And so, you are simply not prepared to empathize with Iqbal's (Vicky Kaushal's) gentle persona, and when you do, it his vulnerable humanity hits you like a truck. Conversely, the hardened Indian intelligence agent Mir is many things during the movie, but 'human' he is not. I walked away from the theater understanding better the nature of such wars, and that the real conflict is not over Kashmir, or between two sides, or between ideologies. The real conflict is always fought within the human heart: between the ruthless imperatives of duty, and the very human urges of gentleness, mercy and love.",bharaths-435-1489222,May/2018,10, A tight no-nonsense thriller with excellent acting,1,"[raazi, bollywood, movie, right, pull, tight, script, good, act, realistic, believable, storyline, leaf, edge, seat, two, hour, film, also, manages, maintain, tight, pace, building, towards, impactful, climax, particular, think, three, thing, make, unforgettable, firstly, act, point, make, movie, turn, alia, bhatt, turn, absolute, genius, come, long, way, year, day, justice, kind, role, vicky, kaushal, good, beguile, husband, restrain, yet, emotional, male, character, support, powerful, female, lead, bollywood, rarity, thoroughly, enjoyable, others, point, minor, actor, like, jaideep, ahlawat, rajit, kapoor, deliver, strong, performance, secondly, movie, turn, tight, point, melodramatic, display, emotion, sappy, song, good, old, premise, bride, depart, husband, household, presumably, ...]","[raazi, does, very few bollywood movies, do right, it, pulls, off, a tight script, with, good acting, a realistic believable storyline, leaves, you, on, the edge, of, your seat, for, two hours, the film, also manages, to, maintain, a tight pace, while, building, up towards, an impactful climax, in, particular, i, think, three things, made, it, unforgettable, firstly, acting was, on, point, made, the movie, it, turned out, to, be, bhatt, is turning out, to, be, an absolute genius, has come, a long way, from, her, student, of, the year, days, are, very few, in, her, peer-group, can do justice, to, these kinds, of, roles, vicky kaushal, was, good, as, beguiled, husband, his, restrained, yet emotional male character, supporting, a powerful female lead, is, a bollywood rarity, was, thoroughly enjoyable, the others, are, on, point, too, with, minor actors, like, jaideep ahlawat and rajit kapoor, delivering, strong performances, secondly, the movie, turned out, to, be, ...]",114.53694218488363,-20.61292212769414,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,1,1,4,0,5,5,4,6.294392523364487,214,265,raazi bollywood movies right pulls tight script good acting realistic believable storyline leaves edge seat hours film manages maintain tight pace building towards impactful climax particular think things made unforgettable firstly acting point made movie turned alia bhatt turning absolute genius long way student year days peer group justice kinds roles vicky kaushal good beguiled husband restrained yet emotional male character supporting powerful female lead bollywood rarity thoroughly enjoyable others point minor actors like jaideep ahlawat rajit kapoor delivering strong performances secondly movie turned tight point melodramatic displays emotion sappy songs good old premises bride departing husbands household presumably good arranged marriage virtually unknown man eventual marriage consummation present theory typically perfect opportunities inject unnecessary bridal parting songs lengthy wedding song dance sequences boys side girls side etc worst song balancing sleaze indian culture read censor board mandated restraint plays marriage consummated typically couple kissing rolling around bed carefully clothing privates velvet satin sheets raazi eliminates fluff leaving wishing movies would away crap favor keeping pace plot lastly importantly raazi justice complexity india pakistan conflict countries shared history makes war painfully unique e g abdul oldest faithful caretaker pakistani household indian origin movie takes sides shows humanity ruthlessness exist sides significant departure patriotic films yesteryear habituated seeing good vs evil theme pakistanis depicted soulless warmongers simply prepared empathize iqbals vicky kaushals gentle persona vulnerable humanity hits like truck conversely hardened indian intelligence agent mir many things movie human walked away theater understanding better nature wars real conflict kashmir sides ideologies real conflict always fought within human heart ruthless imperatives duty human urges gentleness mercy love,0.1086538461538462,0.5171474358974361,1

Rage (2014) - IMDb,"This movie is fantastic - honestly, it's shooting up my 'So Bad It's Good' charts with a bullet (badoom-tish!) I have no idea why Danny Glover's character is in it. Feels like he phoned someone and said, 'I need fifty bucks and I'm free on Sunday. Anything going down?' Peter Stormare, whilst generally good fun in crap flicks, is so utterly miscast it's borderline genius. What's that accent Pete? I can't tell if you mean to sound like a Canadian with palsy, or you were battling some gastro/intestinal thing, but damn bro, you sound pretty crook. Cage with his helmet or hair or whatever that thing is on his head is brilliant. Injecting heartfelt emotion into scenes that don't need it, screaming in new and obscure ways, playing it cool after trashing 20 corpses and fifty cars, he just injects a well-needed shake-up on traditional acting. Let's be completely inappropriate and flip between ham and wood - hello Oscar! Script has the bones of something in it, but the director has taken a leaf out of Cage's book here - let's not polish the turd, but rough it up some. Camera-work is just dire, dialogue makes the idea of a four-hour cunnilingus session on an angle grinder sound appealing, and seeing as Glover already took fifty from the budget, it left only another fifty for the rest of the film. And let's not forget such a momentous closing scene. Never have I cheered so hard for Cage. Top work fella, and the right choice.

Ran (1985) - IMDb,"Akira Kurosawa's 1985, Ran, is based one of Shakespeare's greatest works, King's Lear. The Film proudly stands along with his other classic such as Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Roshomon, Sanjuro and the Hidden Fortress. He is a master in the art of filmmaking, no one can film an epic battle scene quite like Kurosawa. This is recognized as the most expensive film ever made by Akira Kurosawa, it was at that time, Japan's most expensive film ever. Being at the age of 75, he still showed us, he's one of the best in the business.This movie is about an aging lord, head of the Ichimonji family, decides to retire and to pass the power to Taro, the eldest of his three sons. He will however have to banish Saburo, the youngest one, who dared to speak the truth to him. Soon, the former lord is chased away from the castles of his sons and becomes mad when he understands that one of his sons is trying to kill him. The three brothers are fighting for control of the Kingdom, as their lust for power grows every day. Four armies are facing each other on the prairie. Lord Ichimonji's former peaceful kingdom is nothing but a distant memory.Akira Kurosawa redefines what an epic film is, with astonishing story telling, entirely believable characters and real life battle scenes without the use of Special effects/CGI. He retells the story of King Lear in his own way and no one would recognize that it was actually a adaptation beforehand. But just like Shakespeare, there is humor, irony, death and not a happy ending. Everyone who played a part in the production of this film, deserves some kind of recognition. The acting is pretty much excellent and certainly believable.10/10 Kurosawa is a Genius",Loving_Silence19,August/2010,10, The Best Film based on one of Shakespeare Best Works.

Ran (1985) - IMDb,"Realizing that it is practically heresy in the film world to criticize a Kurosawa film, much less downright dislike it, I'd like to precede my review by saying that I have absolutely loved every Kurosawa film I've seen  until now. ""Ran"", Kurosawa's 1985 film based somewhat on Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" is the story of an elderly emperor who hands down his kingdom to the oldest of his three sons. While the oldest and middle son fan over each other, saying that they are not deserving, etc. it is the youngest who speaks his mind about the subject, incurring the wrath of his father and ultimately, banishment from the area. Meanwhile, the two older sons are making a mess of things with the kingdom, leading to wars, fratricide and the dismissal of their father, even attempting his murder. None of their motives are noble or honorable, only avarice and power motivate them, leading to tragedy for all.Going into this, I knew that this was not going to be a light story by any means. For anyone who has read or is familiar with Lear, it is a story that is pretty much slogged through, though it is wonderfully told. ""Ran"" can pretty much be described the same way. While I certainly appreciated the good acting, the unbelievable costumes and the set design as a whole, I found myself unable to become engaged in the story. The pacing was extremely slow, certainly not an easy thing to deal with during a film that lasts about 2 hours and 40 minutes. Unfortunately, for myself at least, it is the pacing, visuals and story that can really make a foreign film a success for me, and I found that ""Ran"" only had one compelling element out of the three, which managed to save it from being an absolute dud, but not enough to make it as awesome as Kurosawa's other films are.

Rangasthalam (2018) - IMDb,"I was awed while watching the movie, a Telugu movie in ages, made with pure heart and soul.
You don't see actors on screen, only the characters with full heart and soul. Each character was potrayed beautifully with 200% effort by all the actors. I had my expectations while looking at cast but wow ever actor did more than 200% justice to their characters, which can be directly attributed to director Sukumar's effort in direction department, raw and realistic art work, beautiful cinematography, each and every other department.I was waiting for Sukumar to show his potential on such realistic movie rather than trying to make an intelligent movies which has no heart and soul. We all know what he is capable of but I am finally glad that he decided to work on such a beautiful script like Rangasthalam rather than pointless intellectual movies which I didn't like personally (this is purely because of my affection towards Sukumar, wanting him to make exceptional movies only).Coming to performances, Ramcharan was a standout as Chittibabu, I felt the character deeply realistic like many people we see in villages, innocent, pure at heart and stubborn at the same time, this is an outstanding performance by Ram Charan, I can't say anything about awards/rewards, but he won my heart with this movie.If this movie doesn't win any major Indian awards this year, we can only pray the god to give working brains to the awards committees.This is one of a kind movie came in Telugu after a long time.

Red Cliff II (2009) - IMDb,"The battle of the Red Cliff, which is the climax from the first half of ""Romance of the Three Kingdom"" by Luo Guanzhong is perhaps the most spectacular war story in all of Asia. Until the outbreak of Russo-Japanese war, it certainly was one of the biggest battle of the region, and perhaps the biggest in terms of numbers of people involved.Director John Woo assembled an international talent of actors to create this one of a kind epic movie. He's described it as 50% fictional, but he must have put lot of thoughts into the fiction part, because all the filling that he puts in works to enhance the story, and brings excitement to each scene.The story is somewhat long, and for ones who are not familiar with the historic saga of this battle, may feel that it's overly protracted, but the movie was geared mainly for the Chinese audience (China bankrolled the film), who are intimately familiar with the characters described in this story. I'm sure many went to the theaters to see their favorite heroes come to life.The casting is done exceptionally well, as they convey the authority of the characters they are playing. Clever casting from different countries around Asia (China, Korea, Japan, and Taiwan) ensured that people of those countries will not see it as foreign film, but one of their own.This certainly is the best warrior based movie to come out of China, and even for the jaded director John Woo, the greatest masterpiece.

Red Cliff II (2009) - IMDb,"The massive battle scene reminded me of the ""magnum opus""- Hero directed by Zhang Yimou years ago, and the last ""classic lines""( I lost the battle due to the whirl of wind and a cup a tea) by Cao Cao triggered my laughter nerve and Chen Daoming's classic line in Hero ""The ideal Realm of Sword is ""Peace"" immediately emerged in my mind. Unlike the first part, which was permeated by funny dialogues, the second part obviously aims to convey something substantial to the audience. This part barely give rise to laughter and ironically, a man behind me fell into sleep and grunted. But I have to believe the complete Red Cliff, as well as Wu Ji( The Promise), Shi Mian Mai Fu (House of Flying Daggers) etc have been running into the same mode Zhang Yimou created for the first blockbuster in China Hero. And the audience have been more and more tolerant, even numbed with ridiculous plot and stupid dialogue. The military strategies in this film are even far more ""romantic"" than the Romance of Three Kingdoms and proceed smoothly as a miracle, even we forsake the true history, we still can not explain how it could.

Red River (1948) - IMDb,"From 1939 to 1948, two major Westerns done with taste and skill and with an eye to beauty could be mentioned: John Ford's ""Stagecoach,"" and Howard Hawks' ""Red River."" ""Red River"" is a great adventure Western considered as the very best among all Westerns... But could we compared it to Ford's splendidly filmed ""Wagon Master""? John Ford maintains his shooting eye at a certain distance while Howard Hawks keeps it nearby... But both are skilled directors of a bunch of great moviesFord is closer to Western movies, and Hawks to other genre... Ford treats his Western characters as people behave... Hawks displays it in vivid adventure... In ""Red River,"" ""Rio Bravo,"" and ""The Big Sky"" Howard Hawks is far from the magnitude of Ford's ""The Searchers."" Under Ford's instruction, John Wayne is fluent and moderate, refined in conduct and manners as in ""The Quiet Man."" With Hawks, Wayne's character prevails differential tendency toward passion and fury...It is soon evident that the cattle boss is tough to the point of obsession It could be argued that only men of this spirit could have handled and survived the first pioneering cattle drives One of the drovers (John Ireland) wants to make for Abilene but gets no change out of Wayne When the cattle stampede Wayne goes to 'gun-whip' one of the hands, Clift intervenes It was then evident that Wayne was going to drive his men just as hard as he intends to drive the cattle""Red River"" is a Western just as much concerned with human relationships and their tensions as with spectacle and actiona hallmark of Hawks' films and this element is introduced when the pair meet up with a boy leading a cow The boy confirms the wagon-train massacre, and the boy and the cow from then on are included in the partnership This is not only a key-point of the narrative but also a highly symbolic momentFor some years Garfield was the only screen rebel... But in Clift's appearance in ""Red River,"" another rebel was born In ""Red River,"" Clift plays the adopted son who opposes his father's domineering attitudes and behavior towards himself and also towards the cowhands who work for them on the drive to market The struggle between father and adopted son, compels delighted interest... Dunson's unfeeling hardhearted style remembers us Captain Bligh in ""Mutiny on the Bounty."" In the beginning of the film we had admiration for Wayne's persona... We concluded finding him unfriendly, unconscious, unacceptable and faulty... Clift wins our sympathy! Clift was the withdrawn, introverted man who quietly maintains his integrity as he resists all pressures These qualities were summed up in the words of Private Prewitt in ""From Here to Eternity"" probably Clift's finest rebel role! ""Red River"" will remain a film with a unique flavor It has, and will continue to have, its own special niche among honored Westerns With two Academy Award Nomination for Writing, splendid music score by Dmitri Tomkin and excellent acting including the supporting cast, the film had all the concepts of Howard Hawks' quality: vigor in action, reality as opposed to emotions and a faculty of scale...",Nazi_Fighter_David21,November/1999,9," A film which is spectacle at its best , although spectacle is by no means all of it...",1,"[two, major, western, do, taste, skill, eye, beauty, could, mention, john, ford, stagecoach, howard, hawk, red, river, red, river, great, adventure, western, consider, best, among, western, could, compare, ford, splendidly, film, wagon, master, john, ford, maintains, shoot, eye, certain, distance, howard, hawk, keep, nearby, skilled, director, bunch, great, movie, ford, closer, western, movie, hawk, genre, ford, treat, western, character, people, behave, hawk, display, vivid, adventure, red, river, rio, bravo, big, sky, howard, hawk, far, magnitude, ford, searcher, ford, instruction, john, wayne, fluent, moderate, refine, conduct, manner, quiet, man, hawk, wayne, character, prevails, differential, tendency, toward, passion, fury, soon, evident, cattle, ...]","[from, to, two major westerns, done, with, taste and skill, with, an eye, to, beauty could be mentioned, john ford, stagecoach, howard hawks, red river, red river, is, a great adventure, western considered, as, very best, among, all westerns, could, we, compared, it, to, ford, splendidly filmed, wagon master, john ford, maintains, his shooting eye, at, a certain distance, while, howard hawks, keeps, it, nearby, both are, skilled directors, of, a bunch, of, great movies, ford, is, closer, to, western, movies, hawks, to, other, genre, ford, treats, his western characters, as, people, behave, hawks displays it, in, vivid adventure, in, red river, rio bravo, the big sky, howard hawks, is, far, from, the magnitude, of, ford, 's, the searchers, under, ford, instruction, john wayne, is, fluent and moderate, refined, in, conduct and manners, as in, the quiet man, with, hawks, wayne, character, prevails, differential tendency, toward, passion and fury...it, is, soon evident, that, ...]",137.2281770721811,-2.306846066173962,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,0,3,3,1,1,4,1,1,1,0,5,5,0,6.208530805687205,211,294,1939 1948 major westerns done taste skill eye beauty could mentioned john fords stagecoach howard hawks red river red river great adventure western considered best among westerns could compared fords splendidly filmed wagon master john ford maintains shooting eye certain distance howard hawks keeps nearby skilled directors bunch great movies ford closer western movies hawks genre ford treats western characters people behave hawks displays vivid adventure red river rio bravo big sky howard hawks far magnitude fords searchers fords instruction john wayne fluent moderate refined conduct manners quiet man hawks waynes character prevails differential tendency toward passion fury soon evident cattle boss tough point obsession could argued men spirit could handled survived first pioneering cattle drives drovers john ireland wants abilene gets change wayne cattle stampede wayne goes gun whip hands clift intervenes evident wayne going drive men hard intends drive cattle red river western much concerned human relationships tensions spectacle actiona hallmark hawks films element introduced pair meet boy leading cow boy confirms wagon train massacre boy cow included partnership key point narrative highly symbolic moment years garfield screen rebel clifts appearance red river another rebel born red river clift plays adopted son opposes fathers domineering attitudes behavior towards towards cowhands work drive market struggle father adopted son compels delighted interest dunsons unfeeling hardhearted style remembers us captain bligh mutiny bounty beginning film admiration waynes persona concluded finding unfriendly unconscious unacceptable faulty clift wins sympathy clift withdrawn introverted man quietly maintains integrity resists pressures qualities summed words private prewitt eternity probably clifts finest rebel role red river remain film unique flavor continue special niche among honored westerns academy award nomination writing splendid music score dmitri tomkin excellent acting including supporting cast film concepts howard hawks quality vigor action reality opposed emotions faculty scale,0.18942115251897856,0.3753519668737059,1
Red Sonja (1985) - IMDb,"This is Saturday afternoon fodder, and it is great fun. Brigitte Nielsen plays Red Sonja a little as though she is reading her lines off hidden cue cards, in fact the entire cast appears to have received the script on the day they began shooting, but this is still great comic book stuff all the same.

Red Sonja (1985) - IMDb,"Quote of the movie: ""so it is true, only women may touch it"" What was good:The Soundtrack was really good thanks to genus, Ennio Morricone. Red Sonja looked really good in that little cloth piece she wore throughout the movie. There is more red hair in this film than a shedding Irish Setter. What was bad: The little kid playing the ruler of a land terribly over acts. I am not sure if this is because he is a bad kid actor or if it was suppose to be.There was a scene where Arnold rides around hitting people from his horse, but in a wide-angle shot, there is nobody dead on the ground.The special effects for 1985 are fairly lame, including the mechanical spider in the castle lair is so bad-dd.The costumes were designed as if there was a sale at a early 1980's salvation army. Costume of the movie goes to the oriental old man, ""grandmaster"", with the white sheet and black straps is quite a sight. With poles that come out of his back, I don't know how he can enter a doorway. It takes 18 minutes for Arnold to actually read a line.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) - IMDb,"I've no idea how I managed to miss RISE . It came out three years ago and I recall it going on my watch it when it comes out on DVD list but never got round to it for some reason . Now that the sequel DAWN has opened to almost universal praise it's very timely that Channel 4 decided to give it its British TV network broadcast . I saw the trailers on channel 4 last week and made sure I wasn't going to miss it and if I enjoyed this film I might just go out of my way and spend money watching the sequel in the cinema . Hmmmm . After seeing RISE it looks like I've just saved myself the price of a bus ride and a cinema ticket To be fair the producers deserve some credit on not going for a reworking of the original Pierre Boulle novel . A rocket travels to another planet where Apes at the top of the evolutionary ladder and there's a shock twist at the end . It's been done before and very well in the 1968 film and abysmally in the Tim Burton version so congratulations for trying a different spin this time with a reworking of CONQUEST The unfortunate thing is the storyline is very predictable and lacking in any imagination . Okay in CONQUEST apes are used as slaves and it's up to Ceaser a self aware chimpanzee from the future who is a fugitive leading a revolution by apes to overthrow their cruel masters . There's not a lot of realism to that plot but the great strength of the original franchise was that it was made with so much imagination plausibility didn't matter "" The good bomb made us all "" indeed and for that we should be grateful . Here however everything is so recognisable that it ends up becoming , insipid , vapid and very mundane This most especially extends to the humans who are one note clichés . Good scientists , trying to benefit mankind , sick relative , sadistic guard type character and worst of all rabidly greedy corporate company boss . It says something that the best performance comes from Andy Serkis and he plays the film in a CGI suit swinging through trees and rattling bars but to be fair again Daniel Day Lewis would be incapable of bringing much to the roles of humans in this screenplay There's a saying that "" If you give enough chimpanzees enough typewriters they will eventually write the complete works of Shakespeare "" Apparently this is an untrue truism and according to the likes of Richard Dawkins and other scientists involved in biology there's neither enough chimpanzees or typewriters for this to remotely come close to happening . That said if you give a typewriter to someone like Paul Dehn and sit him in a committee of Hollywood film producers he can string out a highly entertaining and imaginative series of movies based upon a film adaptation of Pierre Boulle;s original novel.

Rise: Blood Hunter (2007) - IMDb,"I saw the trailer of this a while back and thought it could be one of those sleeper hits, as it had a relatively good premise and I've always been intrigued by vampire films, so when I saw it on the shelves I thought I'd give it a go.As the film was overall a disappointment for me, I won't put any spoilers in this review. I will say however that from the outset, the sequence of events are disjointed and make for confusing viewing. The film tries to be too clever throughout and ultimately ends up being hard to follow. For a vampire film, it doesn't really give much background to the whole vampire genre as most do and adds to the confusion as to who is who and what is what. Apart from Lucy Liu's character, there is no back story or build up to the antagonists, everything just happens randomly, which makes it an effort to keep track of things.As for the acting, I find it a shame that Lucy Liu continues to make films that don't really challenge her. She spends most of this film looking either in distress or moody, oh and naked. Having seen her in Kill Bill and her earlier turns in Ally McBeal, Rise & Ecks vs Sever really don't do her justice as an actress. The vampire contingent here are pretty poor too, with James D'Arcy playing a poor mans version of every other bad vampire we've seen before (notably Stephen Dorff in Blade). Michael Chiklis is at best, mediocre, looking like he did this when short of a few bob, in his spare time from filming Silver Surfer.Overall, another addition to the growing number of mediocre vampire-themed films.

RoboCop (1987) - IMDb,"RoboCop (1987) is the finest cyberpunk action movie one of my favorite films of all time. I grew up with this movie, it has a special place in my heart and I love it to death. Here you have everything: brilliant story, good actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and good Special Effects. This is Paul Verhoeven and Peter Weller's best movie from the 80's they ever made. I used to had this movie on VHS but over the years the tape was eaten from VHS recorder so that I couldn't watch the movie properly anymore. 3 years earlier I got this movie on Blu-ray Unrated director's cut and my Blu-ray player scratched and eat the Blu-ray disc so I purchased the director's cut again on Blu-ray and I was blown away with the movie how good it is. RoboCop it's not an action in the film itself, that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $50 million budget (in 1987!), with multiple huge explosions, with hundreds of bullets fired, and scores of stuntmen used. 30 year's anniversary is coming in July since the movie was released and it is a shame that Miguel Ferrer aka Bob Morton died this year in January R.I.P. we miss you. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task.The movie it self has heart and soul in it, the fact is you have a human being who loses his humanity and it brought back to life, he is resurrected and he is a superhuman super cop who once again regains his humanity and his trouble been robot and human. When Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) takes off his helmet we see a sad mourning man who lost everything. I felt really sorry for Alex who was shot and killed I was really moved and sad by his death who lost his family. Peter Weller stars in the film as Alex Murphy, a Detroit police officer who after being gunned down by a vicious gang, is resurrected by a mega-corporation as the cybernetic law enforcement officer of the future. As he begins his new life as ""RoboCop"", Murphy starts to regain a bit of his humanity with the help of his former partner Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). The popularity of the RoboCop character would spawn a RoboCop franchise consisting of, among other media, two more feature films, a 1994 live-action series, two animated television series, a four-part movie miniseries as well as a 2014 remake.Actors Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith and Miguel Ferrer do all job well and they deliver the movie as an entertaining action flick. I love the puppetry of droid ED-209 who has a lot of fire power and the costume and the suit for RoboCop was beautiful designed. Themes that make up the basis of RoboCop include media influence, gentrification, corruption, authoritarianism, greed, privatization, capitalism, identity, dystopia, and human nature. It is an rated R action film and I wish there would be movies like this today. I love the Music score by Basil Poledouris which it is my favorite score and it is a classic orchestra. The stunts are completely insane in scale (we have a lot of glass scenes like Ed-209 fires cannon guns on Robo and he flies trough glass door. Robo fires his gun on Dick (Ronnie Cox) and he flies trough window.) Robo punches a terrorist in mayor's office and he falls from the window. Of course, this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The gunplay is delivered in perfect Verhoeven style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you'll see lots of heavy automatic, shotguns and explosive cannon weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody with real blood squibs.It is also up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they're evenly spaced through the movie. I love how RoboCop prevents two armed robberies, a rape which he shoots the rapist in the dick, he bust a drug factory on by him self, he stops and punches a terrorist and saves the hostages in the mayor office, he stops a violent gang by himself and he stops a corrupt business man. Best scene: ED-209 moves its right gun-arm cannon on RoboCop (Peter Weller) but Robo grabs it and shoves it away just before ED fires. ED continues firing as Robo shoves the gun towards ED's left gun-arm, destroying it. ED-209 fires one of its missiles at RoboCop. The missiles were actual rockets guided with wires. RoboCop is a 1987 American cyberpunk action film directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner. The film stars Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Dan O'Herlihy, Kurtwood Smith, Miguel Ferrer, and Ronny Cox.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) - IMDb,"Just like the thousands of Star Wars fans out there in the world, I was absolutely giddy when I heard that J.J. Abrams was taking the director's helm for the seventh installment of George Lucas's beloved space opera. After I saw the Force Awakens, I was not sure how I felt about the movie. It has gotten so many rave reviews and I desperately wanted to feel the same way. After some time since its release and the adrenaline rush has worn out, I can honestly say that it was a big disappointment for me as a Star Wars fan. I will not get into the reasons as to why that is since the top reviews of Force Awakens do a superb job pointing out the flaws of that monstrosity.So anyhow, I went to see this film with low expectations because of my previous disappointment with the recent addition of the Star Wars franchise. Boy, was I wrong.Gareth Edwards puts the WARS in Star Wars unlike I've seen AND felt in the previous films. The dark and serious tone of the film makes you feel the rebel's fear of gruesome warfare as they fight against the more well- equipped and ruthless Empire. At one point, the film was reminiscent of WWII films due to its excellent portrayal of battle scenes. The acting and dialogue was for the most part well done, and the comic reliefs in the film did not feel as forced as *ahem FORCED Awakens.The director also does an excellent job connecting the prequels and the original series together. If a viewer sees the series in the numbered order with this film, the story line will play out seamlessly.And lastly, Darth Vader's scenes in the film definitely adds a terrifying legacy to his name. I will not spoil the scenes for you, but he portrays ruthlessness here that was not seen in the other films. The viewer will have a better grasp as to why he is such a feared character in the universe.J.J. Abrams diminished my love for Star Wars.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) - IMDb,"I've been an avid Star Wars fan since 1977. I've seen all the live action films multiple times and even sat through the Holiday Special and the Ewok spin-offs. I was looking forward to Rogue One and booked tickets well in advance for the first show of the first day.I was surprised to find the cinema mostly deserted - especially after the full houses I experienced during the first couple of weeks of The Force Awakens' run. Having watched all the trailers, TV spots and clips, I had a good idea what to expect and, as the film began, those expectations were justified. This was a more 'grown-up' Star Wars: darker, more violent and morally ambiguous. I was loving it and thinking it might well turn out to be my new favourite Star Wars film.But... it began to feel very rushed. The action sequences and special effects were superb and there was no doubt this was a film set in the Star Wars universe but characters were being introduced and killed-off at such a pace it was hard to keep up and even harder to care about them. We were whizzed at breakneck pace from planet to planet (complete with some slightly jarring captions to tell us where we were) and then it suddenly began to sag. As the hastily assembled Rebel crew went on their mission to find Galen I began to lose interest and even found myself nodding off. It was all a bit boring.The pace soon picked up and I got back into it but I was disappointed with Vader's first appearance and completely distracted by the CGI Tarkin. Vader seemed too small physically, the voice sounded off and the dialogue (especially the final quip) seemed out of character. Resurrecting Peter Cushing in digital form was a brave move but the technology is still not quite there and I began to feel more detached from the plot and characters as I analysed the strangeness of his appearance. As the film moved to its final act, I was wowed by the visuals but, by now, I had no real interest in the characters and their deaths just came and went with no emotional impact. In fact, my mind was wandering as I noticed more and more how much of the previously released footage wasn't in the final cut of the film - including some of the most spectacular shots such as the TIE fighter looming in front of Jyn on the gantry and the beautiful shot of Krennic striding towards the shore surrounded by the floating bodies of his troops. Rogue One had lost me and was beginning to disappoint.As Vader made his final appearance I was, at last, feeling some excitement. It was a great scene but... that final shot of CGI Leia was a real 'What? Why? No!' moment. Terrible. Less in this case would definitely have been more.As the film ended, there was no applause and everybody got up and left immediately, leaving me to watch the credits alone feeling more than a little underwhelmed. It is not a bad film. The design and special effects (CGI human faces not withstanding) are superb. The cast are interesting and do a good job with very limited characterisation. But Rogue One ultimately failed to involve me emotionally in the story or characters and, in the end, it kind of felt like watching somebody else play a beautiful video game.",gareth-mattison-887-25248916,December/2016,5, Ultimately Underwhelming,0,"[avid, star, war, fan, since, see, live, action, film, multiple, time, even, sat, holiday, special, ewok, look, forward, rogue, one, book, ticket, well, advance, first, show, first, surprise, find, cinema, mostly, desert, especially, full, house, experienced, first, couple, week, force, awakens, run, watch, trailer, tv, spot, clip, good, idea, expect, film, begin, expectation, justified, star, war, darker, violent, morally, ambiguous, love, think, might, well, turn, new, favourite, star, war, begin, feel, rush, action, sequence, special, effect, superb, doubt, film, set, star, war, universe, character, introduce, pace, hard, keep, even, harder, care, whiz, breakneck, pace, planet, planet, complete, slightly, jarring, caption, ...]","[i, have been, an avid star wars, fan, since, i, have seen, all the live action, films, multiple times, even sat, through, the holiday, special, the ewok spin-offs, i, was looking, forward, to, rogue, booked, tickets, well, in, advance, for, the first show, of, the first day.i, was surprised, to, find, the cinema, mostly deserted, especially, after, the full houses, i experienced, during, the first couple, of, weeks, of, the force, awakens, run, having watched, all the trailers, tv spots and clips, i, had, a good idea, to, expect, as, the film, began, those expectations, were justified, was, more, grown-up, star wars, darker, more violent and morally ambiguous, i, was, loving it, thinking, it, might well turn out, to, be, my new favourite star wars, film.but, it, began, to, feel very rushed, the action sequences, special effects, were, superb, was, doubt, was, a film, set, in, the star wars, universe, characters, were being introduced, killed-off, at, such, a pace it, was, hard, to, ...]",129.34040103243888,-12.191288382380307,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,1,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.7302325581395355,215,282,avid star wars fan since 1977 seen live action films multiple times even sat holiday special ewok spin offs looking forward rogue booked tickets well advance first show first day surprised cinema mostly deserted especially full houses experienced first couple weeks force awakens run watched trailers tv spots clips good idea expect film began expectations justified grown star wars darker violent morally ambiguous loving thinking might well turn new favourite star wars film began feel rushed action sequences special effects superb doubt film set star wars universe characters introduced killed pace hard keep even harder care whizzed breakneck pace planet planet complete slightly jarring captions us suddenly began sag hastily assembled rebel crew went mission galen began lose interest even found nodding bit boring pace soon picked got disappointed vaders first appearance completely distracted cgi tarkin vader seemed small physically voice sounded dialogue especially final quip seemed character resurrecting peter cushing digital form brave move technology still quite began feel detached plot characters analysed strangeness appearance film moved final act wowed visuals real interest characters deaths came went emotional impact fact mind wandering noticed much previously released footage final cut film including spectacular shots tie fighter looming front jyn gantry beautiful shot krennic striding towards shore surrounded floating bodies troops rogue lost beginning disappoint vader made final appearance last feeling excitement great scene final shot cgi leia real moment terrible less case would definitely film ended applause everybody got left immediately leaving watch credits alone feeling little underwhelmed bad film design special effects cgi human faces withstanding superb cast interesting good job limited characterisation rogue ultimately failed involve emotionally story characters end kind felt like watching somebody else play beautiful video game,0.12528554778554774,0.5532750582750583,1
Roja (1992) - IMDb,"This is the first movie of what was to become director Mani Ratnam's ""political trilogy"" (""Bombay"" and ""Dil Se"" being the movies to follow). While not quite as accomplished as the later movies, he develops a very simple story of a young married couple, the subsequent kidnapping of the husband and the wife's attempts to persuade the authorities to help free him into a well-rounded movie that works on almost all levels that it encompasses:The love relationship between the two main characters is credible and well-handled; the struggle of the individual citizen vs. government authorities and individual desires vs. the larger scale of politics is dealt with intensely (the scene where the Colonel tells Roja that ""everyone is happy"" is simply chilling), and even the interplay of the kidnapped and the terrorists works out really well, even if it seems sometimes that Rishi Kumar was lucky ending up with these rather than more ruthless people.The only problem that I have with this movie are a small handful of scenes in which Indian patriotism is showcased in what I felt was a rather blunt manner (but then, coming from a different country, I may lack some essential cultural background to understand it).Apart from this one quibble I think it's a good movie that you should really see, especially I've you've seen Mani Ratnam's other films. Acting is solid, especially from Pankaj Kapoor as the terrorist leader, but also from Arvind Swamy as Rishi (except perhaps when he goes into patriotic overdrive). Also on-screen chemistry between Arvind and Madhoo is fabulous. The music is an early, often charming (""Dil hai chhota sa"") score by A. R.

Rurouni Kenshin Part I: Origins (2012) - IMDb,"First off - many of the reviewers thus far seem to be comparing this movie adaptation to ""Samurai X"" instead of its source material which is the manga. What they must realize is that ""Samurai X"" was an OVA created for western audiences done by people who had no connection with the manga or the original anime and thus was a departure from the original intent and feel of what the creator of the manga had in mind. He even disagreed with how ""Samurai X"" ended regarding the fate of Kaoru and Kenshin, so much so that he insisted on having the proper ending he envisioned for his own characters put into a collector's box edition of the original anime released in Japan. Even though it was gorgeously rendered, it was overly depressing and moody. Whether you want to believe it or not, Kenshin really wasn't that way. The whole point of his redemption was that, in spite of the pain of his past, he was still able to appreciate the simple joys in life and even laugh at things. The Kenshin in ""Samurai X"" was a somber, overly-wrought, super-tortured fellow who was awash with his own suffering. As a fan of RK, seeing him portrayed that way in ""Samurai X"" really broke my heart because a huge chunk of his personality went missing and all that was left was this emo dude. Onto the review: PLOT/STORY: Understandably, this movie had a hard time trying to capture everything in the first volume of the manga in just over two hours. Because the manga was continuous, there was no way for the movie to be cut and dry in terms of villains and side characters. The director had to draw the line somewhere so the movie could have an ending. So, many fan favorite scenes were cut or changed in order to accommodate a more fluid movie. Time constraints didn't allow for a deep fleshing out of all the characters but, since this the first installment of other movies to come (it has been greenlit as a continuing series) I suspect that the audience is going to be exposed to that over time. I was taken aback at just how many things were changed (Sano's intro, Jin'e's concocted connection to Kanryu, Hanya's choice of weapons, the Oniwabanshu but no Aoshi?!) but I felt they did their best to stay true to the spirit of the story by trying to streamline events. There is even a flashback scene of Kenshin's past included in this movie but it gave you a hint (just a hint) of his tortured past and leaves you wondering.ACTORS: The casting was very well done for this movie. Kenshin is supposed to be relatively diminutive and almost feminine in his looks and stature (the creator based him on an actual historical figure who could carry out assassinations in broad daylight, he was that good), which is why people always underestimated him in a fight or commented on his slight figure. He was a Jekyll and Hyde that way. He could go from unassuming, humble Rurouni to out-and-out killer who's eyes would change into a murderous gaze when the ""hitokiri"" side was provoked (straight outta the manga). You could say Kenshin can ""hulk-out"" lol. Sato, with his pretty looks and physicality, really did well in portraying the conflicted character of Kenshin. Emy was cute as a button, perhaps too cute, since Kaoru is supposed to be a bit more plain and a tomboy but it was satisfying to see her bickering with Yahiko. The kid playing Yahiko was spot-on with the brashness and stubborn pride. Sanosuke's portrayal was a little goofy. There is no allusion to what drives Sano into being a fighter for hire but read the manga for clarification and you will see why he and Kenshin create such a strong bond of friendship. In the movie, there was no time to do so, I guess and Sano's a lot tougher than he is portrayed. Megumi's actress did her justice, I think. Again, not too deep in fleshing out her past either but still, you can see her intelligence and intensity underneath her manipulations. Lastly, Saitou's actor was awesome. He captured the cold, brutal carriage of the Wolf of Mibu very well with his stoic face and the constant badgering of Kenshin. I will stop at the main characters or else this will be too long. All in all, the casting was superb.MUSIC AND CINEMATOGRAPHY: The music ranges from fairly modern (techno beats with tribal vocals) to standard orchestral. I don't remember hearing any traditional Japanese instruments being played over scenes but I could be mistaken. Sometimes the music seemed to be out of place or over-used. For example, dramatic fight scenes seemed to bring out that techno song again and again). A part of me wishes they had somehow incorporated Kenshin's theme from the original anime series; just s simple wooden flute part or something as a nod since it's so recognizable. Otherwise it was fine. The look of the movie is fantastic. Whether it's a war-torn forest or just a village scene or a shot of Kaoru's dojo, it looks thick and substantial. I remember seeing shots of the creator of the manga (Nobuhiro Watsuki) on the set of the movie and watching over the set building. It gave me great comfort that he was there to see it through.Overall, this is one of the best, if not THE best, live-action adaptations of a manga I've yet seen. For those of you who are going to see it, if you haven't read the manga yet it certainly isn't required in order to enjoy the movie but it was thoroughly more enjoyable to see these beloved characters come to life on screen. In any case, I am greatly looking forward to the next installment and will relish in trying to figure out what storyline is going to be featured next!!",jennifer-chough1,January/2013,8," Even With

Rurouni Kenshin Part I: Origins (2012) - IMDb,"What is the origin of a ""hero"" in modern film? The character Zorro, penned well over a century ago, is often credited, by film historians, as being the prototype superhero, in that he had a secret identity, great skill. and fought evil while wearing a disguise. Note however that Zorro was a mere mortal with great skill but lacked super powers or mutant blood. An important point. This writer has more than once said the greatest hero in American fiction is a character named Bob Lee Swagger. Swagger appeared in a series of novels by Stephen Hunter, some merely good, some simply staggering in their ability to weave a good tale. (Hunter had a love/hate relationship with his own character and in different novels, tried alternatively to kill him; age him to the point of uselessness; and. finally, replace him with his own son. Hollywood took one shot at bringing Bob Lee to the screen - in a film suitably named Shooter -- and botched it. The actor they cast did not resemble the fictional character at all, and the movie, while well received, had none of the flair of the hardcover novel). Which brings us to Rurouni Kenshin. In Japan, one could argue, this is their prototype hero. An ordinary man with a great skill -- the sword -- who used his skills as a killing machine in battle; and, the moment the war ended, swore he would never kill again. (But he does tend to get into fights. He carries a ""reverse blade"" sword, great for whacking an opponent, but not for cutting.) This is a VERY popular series in Japan, based on a manga, turned into a TV series, two live action films, and, for all I know, maybe a breakfast cereal. This is the more recent of the two live action films and, while true to the story, lacks even a pretence of charisma which, ironically, is that what one would expect from such a work. My advice to the Japanese -- the next try -- and there will be one -- find an adaptation that makes the character as interesting as he was originally drawn. Sometimes just repeating the original creates an echo -- and nothing more.",A_Different_Drummer19,November/2013,5," Everything you could ever want from your hero, but charisma",0,"[origin, hero, modern, film, character, zorro, pen, well, century, ago, often, credit, film, historian, prototype, superhero, secret, identity, great, skill, fought, evil, wear, disguise, note, however, zorro, mere, mortal, great, skill, lack, super, power, mutant, blood, important, point, writer, say, great, hero, american, fiction, character, name, bob, lee, swagger, swagger, appear, series, novel, stephen, hunter, merely, good, simply, stagger, ability, weave, good, tale, hunter, relationship, character, different, novel, try, alternatively, kill, age, point, uselessness, finally, replace, son, hollywood, take, one, shot, bring, bob, lee, screen, film, suitably, name, shooter, botch, actor, cast, resemble, fictional, character, movie, well, receive, none, flair, ...]","[is, the origin, of, hero, in, modern film, the character zorro, penned, well, over, a century, ago, is often credited, by, film historians, as, being, the prototype superhero, in that, he, had, a secret identity, great skill, fought, evil, while, wearing, disguise, note, however, that, zorro, was, a mere mortal, with, great skill, lacked, super powers, mutant blood, an important point, this writer, has, more, than, once said, the greatest hero, in, american fiction, is, a character, named, bob lee swagger, swagger, appeared, in, a series, of, novels, by, stephen hunter, merely good, simply staggering, in, their ability, to, weave, a good tale, hunter, had, a love/hate relationship, with, his own character, in, different novels, tried, alternatively, to, kill, him, age him, to, the point, of, uselessness, finally, replace, him, with, his own son, hollywood, took, one shot, at, bringing, bob lee, to, the screen, in, a film, suitably named, ...]",7.643857418386334,-6.5411976152785565,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,5.784722222222222,144,183,origin hero modern film character zorro penned well century ago often credited film historians prototype superhero secret identity great skill fought evil wearing disguise note however zorro mere mortal great skill lacked super powers mutant blood important point writer said greatest hero american fiction character named bob lee swagger swagger appeared series novels stephen hunter merely good simply staggering ability weave good tale hunter love hate relationship character different novels tried alternatively kill age point uselessness finally replace son hollywood took shot bringing bob lee screen film suitably named shooter botched actor cast resemble fictional character movie well received none flair hardcover novel brings us rurouni kenshin japan could argue prototype hero ordinary man great skill sword used skills killing machine battle moment war ended swore would never kill tend fights carries reverse blade sword great whacking opponent cutting popular series japan based manga turned tv series live action films know maybe breakfast cereal recent live action films true story lacks even pretence charisma ironically would expect work advice japanese next adaptation makes character interesting originally drawn sometimes repeating original creates echo nothing,0.19160173160173158,0.5778231292517008,1

Rush (2013) - IMDb,"The film is just over 2 hours long, but when it was over it seemed like I had been in the cinema about 30 minutes. The film centres on the battle for the 1976 Formula 1 World Championship, and the rivalry between the Austrian ""professor"" Nikki Lauda and the British playboy James Hunt. The two are depicted as enemies, but in actual fact they were good friends who trusted and respected each other on, as well as off-track. This bit of artistic licence does not spoil the film and is reasonable in order to make the battle between the two for the F1 crown more intense. The film is nicely paced. We are introduced to both characters through their own narrative and scenes that leave the watcher in no doubt as to their background and philosophy on life. The two are first seen in competition in 1970 at a Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace (where they have a coming together) and sets the scene for the rivalry throughout the film. I'm not sure if this is further artistic licence. The two definitely did race each other in F3, but I am not convinced as to whether this actual incident occurred. After that we are given a whistle stop journey between 1973 (when Hunt came into F1) to 1975. We are shown the dangerous nature of F1 at the time with the Francois Cevert accident at Watkins Glen in gory detail – although this does not seem like gratuitous, but necessary to bring home just how unforgiving the sport was back then – and it truly was (of the top 12 points scorers in 1976, F1 cars were to claim 3, 1 ended up in a wheelchair and 1 had his career ended by a leg crunching crash). We are then taken to 1976 and that titanic struggle for the World Crown. Only one real issue here – the British Grand Prix result, but I suspect this was simplified in the interests of time. The casting is superb. Chris Hemsworth, an Aussie, does an excellent job on public schoolboy James Hunt, while Daniel Bruhl both sounds and looks frighteningly like the Austrian. There is little room for a supporting cast amongst the drivers which is a shame – only Clay Regazzoni has a part of any real substance. Peterson, Watson, Depailler, Scheckter, Andretti et al could have featured a little more I think. What did their contemporaries think of the two protagonists? The supporting cast is mainly required for Hunt – Lord Hesketh, ""Bubbles"" Horsley and Teddy Mayer / Tyler Alexander of McLaren, while the Ferrari team principals are rarely seen. The love angle is perfectly catered for by Olivia Wilde (Hunt's first wife Suzy) and the gorgeous Alexandra Maria Lara - of Downfall fame – as the future Marlene Lauda. Both give quality performances. The attention to detail is superb. Although the tracks are not the actual ones (for understandable reasons) the cars, the helmets, the sponsors are all authentic. The film ""feels"" like it's happening in the 70's.

Saala Khadoos (2016) - IMDb,"Complaint about this movie is that the story is predictable. Yes. Even Airlift movie's story is predictable. And in case of sports based film there's mostly the same story line. ""A coach/player will lose and eventually win themselves or make someone win at the end"". It's the screenplay which makes the difference here!! Screenplay - No-nonsense and straight to the point. It deals with the characters' screen time perfect. Nothing more. Nothing less. Direction - Narration by the director is really good. Not fast paced. But well paced. Director had brought the things required for the film very well .

Madhavan as usual sticks to the character and performed just perfect!! A live example for versatile acting. Other supporting characters contribute their best. Only con is that some unknown faces don't make us feel emotional at times.Music - Soundtrack of the film as audio doesn't bring much. But when combined with the frames of the film creates magic!!

Saala Khadoos (2016) - IMDb,"In these kind of sports movies you already know the story, so the predictability doesn't bother me that much. I watch them for the journey, for the efforts of the characters, and for their magnetism to pull me into cheering for them. This movie lacked in all these aspects.The story is nothing new, same old journey of an underdog player and a coach that has problems with the system. This should have been the weakest link of the movie. Everything else had to be better than this 'done a lot of times' story for this movie to be good, but that's not the case. The screenplay, dialogues, direction, editing, songs, background score and acting, everything seemed forced. It all wanted you to feel that the makers of the movie mean business. That they are making a realistic movie about the problems and harassment faced by women athletes in our sports system. But it failed to evoke those emotions. Every character seemed to be doing things just because the script demanded it. No one seemed to care to connect with the audience. Every scene was just there to make you spoon feed the emotions, be it comedy, drama, or action. The movie lacked a natural flow. It felt as if it was treading a path that was constructed for it. The - not giving a rat's a** about anything other than one player who seems to be bursting of talent - attitude of Madhavan's character was too unreal. Everyone else too seemed to be acting their parts out rather than being the character. The portrayal of how things work in a women's sport in India was clichéd. It didn't make you feel for the poor girls at all. The connection that should've been there by the end of the movie with the player and the coach was not there at all. All in all, it seemed to be a shallow attempt at a story that has been done a lot of times but still has the potential to make your heart feel and cheer for the characters. Pathetic screenplay, poor acting, empty dialogues, shoddy editing, soulless movie. The worst part is that it's rated a 7.7 on IMDb. And that it is in the top 125 Indian movies on the site.

He is flanked by much of the same cast from the original movie, though they're all playing different characters (Which really damages the movies credibility).This time he saves the lives of 9 men and joins them in saving one of their relatives. This time however it's more strategy and action than Yojimbos intricate mind games.Truth be told Sanjuro is a weaker Toho movie than Yojimbo, it isn't as clever and certainly lacks the same level of charm.

Sanjuro (1962) - IMDb,"Tosohiro Mifune again plays the role of the ronin from Kurasawa's previous movie ""Yojimbo"", and both share the theme of a wandering lone warrior in a parody of Clint Eastwood ""man with no name"" Western movies. ""Yojimbo"" was exciting and amusing; ""Sanjuro"", alas, is overlong, repetitive and inferior.The story is about a group of samurai meeting in a shrine, one of whom is the nephew of the region's Chamberlain, who had laughed off the nephew's exposure of corruption in the local government. The nephew had then told the local Superintendent, who expressed belief. The ronin, who happened to be sleeping nearby, had overheard the conversation and warns that the Superintendent is the true criminal...and is proved right when the Superintendent send some assassins to kill the nephew and his friends. The ronin manages to trick the assassins into leaving, and the nephew and his friends learn that the Chamberlain had been kidnapped and held hostage.Sounds exciting, right? But then the movie starts to repeat itself, with people continually looking over walls or opening and closing doors, with the ronin running back and forth and fighting and being upset at having to kill people, with the nephew and his friends being mistrustful of the ronin and causing further grief because of it, with troops marching back and forth.

Aamir Khan as ACP Rathore is superb. he brings alive a cop's passion and determination to cleanse the system of criminals. the action sequences are played out very realistically. Mukesh Rishi as ACP's right hand man is just brilliant! This actor usually plays only ""black"" characters - this surely added to the impact of his performance (for me, at least). There are some truly heart-warming scenes of Rathore with his family. Sonali Bendre as Rathore's love interest provided some (much-needed) light moments. And, finally, Naseeruddin Shah as ghazal singer-cum-terrorist played his part with understated villainy. i love such villains - they seem so real! the climax is truly innovative - it invariably brings a smile to your face.

We get that impression because Ramu says he is inspired by the Hollywood movie, very kind of him. I have seen the movie and can confirm that approx 5% meets with what we have seen in Godfather. Talking about direction, i could write a couple of pages about it, but i prefer to say it is exceptional.

Sarkar (2005) - IMDb,"Yet another version of mother of all gangster flicks-the Classic ""Godfather"" and yet another case of over-hype due to media circus. Sarkar, the 13th Hindi film of Ram Gopal Varma as director is also the weakest in his Underworld trilogy including the other two being the excellent-Satya and Company. The Charisma, the magnetic persona of the two Bachchans playing father-son duo on screen for the first time is definitely a treat to watch out for. Not just strong performances but their perfect chemistry is the biggest scoring point here for which Varma should be applauded. However, the same equation of the duo is missing with the other characters in the film. Reason-the other characters look more like cardboard caricatures esp. the villains represent the typical Bollywood baddies. A character who attracts attention is elder son played by Kaykay but again not able to hold due to half-baked characterization. . The Drama and conflict is brought alive by the excessive use of Close-shots, which brought a claustrophobic effect rightly needed to construct an ambiance. The haunting Score (Amar Mohile) and the sound design (Kunal Mehta, Parikshit Lalwani & Anup Dev), together with dark, murky background overlapped by shinning powerful images (camerawork by Amit Roy) contributes to Visuals so typical of Ramu's style. But there is an overuse of Music though fortunately no songs are there in the film. But can interest of today's ""intelligently growing"" audience be sustained just on shoulders of two performers and strong Visuals ? I don't think so. Surely, audience ""maangey more"" and here film fails to deliver. In any adaptation, in order to add a new dimension, the biggest pre-requisite is the Screenplay, which is sluggish here not being crisp at places, and therefore the pace slackens quite often. What finally audience is subjected to is a highly predictable, very commonplace drama with very little surprise elements. Top Stunt director Allan Amin Ghani is also not in his best form. Some scenes which require a different treatment includes- a Minister is talking foul about Sarkar and the son is overhearing; a very amateurish shoot out in the jail on Sarkar, Sarkar Jr. escapes from the clutches of his enemies, a Son easily motivated to kill his own father, a son is secretly entering his father's room to kill him, a police commissioner slapping Sarkar Jr-all this requires a more realistic, hard-hitting approach which is the back-bone to create the required conflict. The dialogues are weak for eg. look at an amateurish line where a CM says to Sarkar Jr. ""Wo jo Police Commissioner tha na usay maine hata diya"".. The women folk take on Sarkar's working is completely ignored. The uninterrupted negotiations about criminal activities while Sarkar is with his family also look slightly out of place In fact, the film follows a graph quite similar to Ramu's own production-Ab Tak Chhappan. In depicting the battle between good and evil, the other side of life-the law, police, administration, politics is completely ignored. Certainly, more is expected in content. Here the film definitely falls short and could not rise above an average fare. Dear Ramu, agreed that now you are laughing your way to the bank, you definitely need to take some drastic overhauling measures in your film production factory, before it is too late.",sandhirflora17,July/2005,4, sarkar-average ruling,0,"[yet, another, version, mother, gangster, classic, godfather, yet, another, case, due, medium, circus, sarkar, hindi, film, ram, gopal, varma, director, also, weak, underworld, trilogy, include, two, company, charisma, magnetic, persona, two, bachchans, play, duo, screen, first, time, definitely, treat, watch, strong, performance, perfect, chemistry, big, score, point, varma, applaud, however, equation, duo, miss, character, film, character, look, like, cardboard, caricature, esp, villain, represent, typical, bollywood, baddie, character, attracts, attention, elder, son, played, kaykay, able, hold, due, characterization, drama, conflict, brought, alive, excessive, use, brought, claustrophobic, effect, rightly, need, construct, ambiance, haunt, score, amar, mohile, sound, design, kunal, mehta, parikshit, lalwani, ...]","[yet, another version, of, mother, of, all gangster, flicks-the classic, godfather, yet, another case, of, over-hype due, to, media, circus, sarkar, the 13th hindi film, ram, gopal varma, as, director, is, also, weakest, in, his underworld trilogy, including, other, being, the excellent-satya, company, the charisma, the magnetic persona, of, the two bachchans, playing, father-son duo, on, screen, for, the first time, is, definitely, treat, to, watch, out, for, not, just strong performances, their, perfect chemistry, is, biggest, scoring, point, here, for, which varma, should be applauded, however, the same equation, of, the duo, is missing, with, the other characters, in, the film, reason-the other characters, look, more, like, cardboard caricatures esp. the villains, represent, the typical bollywood baddies, a character, attracts, attention, is, elder son, played, by, kaykay, again not able, to, hold, due, to, half-baked, characterization, the drama, conflict, is brought, alive, by, the excessive use, of, close-shots, brought, ...]",183.19897225808788,-30.882359747780622,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,3,1,1,4,1,3,1,0,1,2,0,6.088461538461537,260,317,yet another version mother gangster flicks classic godfather yet another case hype due media circus sarkar 13th hindi film ram gopal varma director weakest underworld trilogy including excellent satya company charisma magnetic persona bachchans playing father son duo screen first time definitely treat watch strong performances perfect chemistry biggest scoring point varma applauded however equation duo missing characters film reason characters look like cardboard caricatures esp villains represent typical bollywood baddies character attracts attention elder son played kaykay able hold due half baked characterization drama conflict brought alive excessive use close shots brought claustrophobic effect rightly needed construct ambiance haunting score amar mohile sound design kunal mehta parikshit lalwani anup dev together dark murky background overlapped shinning powerful images camerawork amit roy contributes visuals typical ramus style overuse music though fortunately songs film interest todays intelligently growing audience sustained shoulders performers strong visuals think surely audience maangey film fails deliver adaptation order add new dimension biggest pre requisite screenplay sluggish crisp places therefore pace slackens quite often finally audience subjected highly predictable commonplace drama little surprise elements top stunt director allan amin ghani best form scenes require different treatment includes minister talking foul sarkar son overhearing amateurish shoot jail sarkar sarkar jr escapes clutches enemies son easily motivated kill father son secretly entering fathers room kill police commissioner slapping sarkar jr requires realistic hard hitting approach bone create required conflict dialogues weak eg look amateurish line cm says sarkar jr  wo jo police commissioner tha na usay maine hata diya women folk take sarkars working completely ignored uninterrupted negotiations criminal activities sarkar family look slightly place fact film follows graph quite similar ramus production ab tak chhappan depicting battle good evil side life law police administration politics completely ignored certainly expected content film definitely falls short could rise average fare dear ramu agreed laughing way bank definitely need take drastic overhauling measures film production factory late,0.05151032003710574,0.5259669398062256,1
Satya (1998) - IMDb,"Ramgopal Varma's hard hitting film on the Bombay Underworld. This movie is a classic from scene one to the climax. When you see this movie you will see history in the making. A hard hitting story of a person from nowhere , Satya. How he joins the underworld gang led by bhiku mhatre. This movie gives one message hard 'CRIME NEVER PAYS'.The scene where chander(snehal dabi) tells a joke, the scene where bhiku mhatre satya vidya and pyaari go for a dinner, the scene where yedda scares the music director romu sagar, the theatre scene, the climax, all these scenes will go down in the history of Indian cinema as classic scenes. Urmila Matondkar as Satya's Girlfriend and Shefali Chaaya as bhiku mhatre's wife are excellent. J.D.Chakravarthi is brilliant as Satya. Manoj Bajpai gives an excellent and award winning performance as bhiku mhatre.He has managed to make the character of bhiku mhatre an immortal one like late amjad khan did for gabbar singh. Govind Namdeo is brilliant as Bhau. Co-script writer saurabh shukla is superb as kallu mama.It is so nice to see that first time writers saurabh shukla & anurag kashyap wrote such a brilliant script. A special mention must be made of the best cameo since rajesh khanna's cameo in andaz, by paresh raawal as commissioner of police.Satya was supposed to be made as a songless film but co-producer Bharat Shah felt that no distributor will buy the film and it will be too tense. Music director Vishal Bharadwaj and lyricist Gulzar were roped in to provide the music for this film and they did a brilliant work. The song 'Sapne Main milti hai' and 'kallu mamma' are too good.

See No Evil (2006) - IMDb,"All right, let's be realistic about this. Nobody goes into a movie produced by WWE Films (whose owner has challenged God to a wrestling match), directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the Between the Cheeks trilogy), starring a wrestler named Kane, and expects a little slice of art on a golden platter. If you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time.So what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this? Well, here's what I was looking forward to:1) Bad acting. 2) A fairly non-existent, clichéd storyline. 3) Kane walking around with a scrunched, sour face that indicates his nostrils just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago. 4) Tons and tons of gore. Well, if you're hungry for some ""so bad it's funny"" entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts.Obviously, movies like this are best seen for free, but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it. The filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offenses on the screen. This makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order. You and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate.I also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find. Tally them up at the end and see who comes up with the most. I think my grand total was 107; can you beat that? I personally want to know how after 35 years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity, running water, and a working elevator?I know, I know, the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is, but that doesn't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it.I also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector) into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms. Uh-huh.I think you pretty much know what to expect, but I feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings. First, if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away. The people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show. Shouts of ""Kill him, Kane!"" and ""I hope you die first!"" and ""Chokeslam!"" echoed through the theater, showcasing what I hope is NOT the best of what America has to offer. I usually don't appreciate such audience interaction, but for a cheesefest like this I thought the commentary added to the entertainment value. However, I can see how others could be annoyed by it.Second, and this shouldn't even warrant explanation, the film doesn't shy away from the gore. If watching a big ugly dude rip eyeballs right out of their sockets doesn't scream ""fun night at the movies!"" for ya then you know good and well to save your dough.I must say that I was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on Kane's part. I wasn't expecting him to put on an acting clinic, but I was hoping he'd have some cute little catchphrase like ""Say goodnight"" (his character's last name is ""Goodnight"") right before he killed a victim. Instead he uttered four words in the entire film - ""Nooooooo!"" and ""I see it."" But hey, he delivered them flawlessly!If I were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like ""Place your BETTS!"" or ""All BETTS are off!"" It'd rule and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror films like See No Evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic. Feel free to send me your suggestions.

Serenity (2005) - IMDb,"The others do a good job gushing about the movie. Sure we're fans and bound to like the movie more than the usual fare, but those looking for an original and thrilling movie experience, this will shock and amaze. The Firefly world introduced a fantasy home for many of us, with characters we truly cared about and dilemmas we could get behind. The best way to describe it is to take the best aspects of the Han Solo elements of the original Star Wars, and build a world around that. There's no grand theme or clear cut good and evil. There's just a band of fugitives trying to make their way in a dangerous sky. It's something folks can relate to, although most of us won't be in a space battle or fighting psychotic creatures anytime soon. The point of the name Serenity is the name of the ship, though in a deeper sense that's what our characters are in search of. Finding freedom and a home, and that's what the ship represents to them, and to the fans. So you understand why so many are so excited about this dinky little scifi flick. The movie captures that beautiful feeling but takes us on a ride that there's no turning back from. In my opinion, the one thing that makes for a truly GREAT movie is if you walk out of the theater a different person than when you walked in. This movie takes you on such a journey I didn't know if I would leave the theater at all. Sure the visual effects are stunning, but even the unfinished effects I saw meant nothing to me because it was the characters I cared about (and note that the digitally created ship itself is one of them, and I cared just as much for that than any of them). The humor is probably better than anything in the theaters this year, and the action is even greater. My screening actually came a week after Episode 3 was released, and I immediately washed my hands of Mr Lucas, and months later when I saw Fantastic 4... well let's not even talk about that one.This movie really does have something for everyone, and even in the core of the geek fandom, the range of people is total - men and women split it at least 50/50, uber-geeks and ""cool"" types, and a surprising amount of attractive people of all ages. Seriously though, don't trust the rants of the fans. Check out the movie for yourself.

AFter seeing the trailer I rented the series, loved it, and since purchasing the DVD have seen it many times. I really looked forward to the movie. Unfortunately, the movie didn't live up to the trailer and was mediocre at best. None of the elements that made the series so enjoyable are present. Gone are deep character development and the lively interaction among the crew members. Book and Inara are really just cameos,while Kaylee, Wash, and even Simon have little to do. The heart of FIREFLY was the relationship between Simon and River, but it's little explored here. Humor and hints of romance are, for the most part, absent. The plot is action-heavy and really is just the crew trying to escape from Reavers. The entire rationale behind the Alliance's desperate need to eliminate River Tam is uninteresting and the explanation for the existence of the Reavers is truly lame. It was much more interesting to have the Reavers be humans who'd gone wild on the outer rim. I kept waiting for the ""two-by-two, hands-of-blue"" creeps to show up but they never did. Finally, the operative's bizarre about-face at the end makes no sense. Seeing this poor feature film makes me love the FIREFLY series even more.

Sherlock Holmes (2009) - IMDb,"... not the movie, but the number of self-professed Holmes aficionados who apparently have no knowledge of Holmes. For the record, Holmes was a miserable, irresponsible drug addict who did indeed sleep on the floor, insult his best friend, experiment on his dog, and never ever wore a deerstalker's cap (at least, not until television was invented). He was a brawler who practiced martial arts and was as likely to slum around in the filthiest of rags as he was a suit.It wasn't until after Doctor Watson took him in hand that he truly refined himself and became a ""respectable"" member of society. And yes, we can tell that this movie takes place THAT early in their relationship because Watson has not yet married his wife (the retconning did annoy me, too, by the way, but you just can't avoid a little re-imagining here and there).Speaking of unavoidable, Irene Adler, Holmes' one uncapturable (is that a word?), simply had to be cast as a potential love interest. The flirting, the romance, and the near-make-out session were irresistible to the director (and to all of the audience who're honest with themselves).That being said, I felt Robert Downey, Jr. played Sherlock Holmes to perfection. His characteristic caustic attitude towards Lestrade and even Watson at times was exactly how I'd imagine him. He gives several summations of his observations and deductions that brought Holmes to life in an almost unparalleled way. His fight scenes (preceded the first few times by superhuman calculations) show both the mental and physical sides of Holmes in ways that Watson's notes can't quite convey, but at which they constantly hint.As for Watson himself, Jude Law delivered a wonderful performance. I was a little skeptical of how well he fought, given Watson's wartime injury, but his character and demeanor were entirely on the nose. His loyalty to Holmes despite his frustrations with him could not have been captured more expertly, I feel. No one, no matter how patient or forgiving, could endure Holmes forever without the occasional confrontation. The original Holmes, after all, was not above insulting his best friend or even deriding his deductive capabilities at times. Nevertheless, Watson never could abandon his friend in his time of need.This version (or vision, if you will) of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's greatest creation may be more swashbuckling, more thrilling, and more edgy than any other incarnation, but that doesn't make it any less faithful to the original.

Sherlock Holmes (2009) - IMDb,"Many people complains about the plot being confusing, but I found it very simple: Two ninjas, Sherlock and Watson (the former said to be very clever) have a fight each five minutes of the film. In-between fights they try to solve a very difficult case about a bad guy (Lord Blackwood) that, as Count Dracula, has the power to get into the minds of the people and make them cause riots and protests everywhere in Victorian London. Although the bad guy’s ambitions are merely political, he also murders women as a hobby and that’s why he is captured by the two ninjas, then prosecuted and finally hanged.Many people go to see the execution, but nobody (not even the clever ninja) notes that the rope from which the bad guy hangs stays loose around his neck. The other ninja, said to be a physician, takes the pulse of the corpse directly on the neck, and realizes that the rope didn’t leave any mark whatsoever in the dead guy’s neck. Admired by how soft these new ropes are, he says nothing and declares him dead.The bad guy wasn’t dead, but he was buried the same under big blocks of granite. This was a very hard task because these blocks were actually very small pieces glued together lightly so that the bad guy could break them from the inside of his grave and it must have required quite a lot of people to put these fragile blocks in place so delicately as not to unglue them. Fortunately for the bad guy no one working at the cemetery noticed this.The film goes on very slowly after that. Anything they investigate is immediately followed by a long fight.Very often Conan Doyle writes about cases that although they look supernatural at the beginning, a sound and rational explanation is provided at the end.Guy Ritchie decides to change this tedious scheme, so that a crescendo is built till the last frame. To achieve this Guy Ritchie applies the rule that if a case looks supernatural, the explanation should be more supernatural than the case itself.So, at the end, we are faced with magical substances (that couldn’t be found till now even in the Pandora moon) like a kind of clear, odorless liquid, that people take as water, which ignites readily and violently with just a spark, distilled cyanhydric acid that kills much better than the relatively pure counterpart so easy to obtain, an antidote thanks to which you can breathe hydrogen cyanide with no ill effects, small sized remote controls made in 1880, and many, many more. No ridicule is spared in explaining what has happened and how.Such a display of fantasy for nothing; at the end the clever ninja cannot explain how the bad guy managed to get into the minds of the people and organize riots telepathically. Maybe there was also a magical gas that was released by the bad guy and caused this, but unfortunately this is not shown in the film.",fabian_24011,February/2010,1, A very simple (and boring) plot...,0,"[many, people, complains, plot, confuse, found, simple, two, ninja, sherlock, watson, former, say, clever, fight, five, minute, film, fight, try, solve, difficult, case, bad, guy, lord, blackwood, count, dracula, power, get, mind, people, make, riot, protest, everywhere, victorian, london, although, bad, guy, ambition, merely, political, also, murder, woman, hobby, capture, two, ninja, prosecute, finally, people, go, see, execution, nobody, even, clever, ninja, note, rope, bad, guy, hang, stay, loose, around, neck, ninja, say, physician, take, pulse, corpse, directly, neck, realizes, rope, leave, mark, whatsoever, dead, guy, neck, admire, soft, new, rope, say, nothing, declares, bad, guy, dead, bury, big, block, ...]","[many people, complains, about, the plot, being, confusing, i, found, it, very simple, two ninjas, sherlock and watson, the former, said, to, be, very clever, have, fight, each five minutes, of, the film, in-between fights they, try, to, solve, a very difficult case, about, a bad guy, lord blackwood, that, as, count dracula, has, the power, to, get, into, the minds, of, the people, make, them, because, riots and protests, everywhere, in, victorian london, although, the bad guy ’ s, ambitions are, merely political, he also murders women, as, a hobby, that, ’ s, why, he, is captured, by, the two ninjas, then prosecuted, finally hanged.many people, go, to, see, the execution, nobody, not even, the clever ninja, notes, that, the rope, from, which the bad guy, hangs stays, loose, around, his neck, the other ninja, said, to, be, a physician, takes, the pulse, of, the corpse, directly, on, the neck, realizes, that, the rope, didn, ’ t leave any mark, whatsoever, in, the dead guy ’ s, ...]",88.72602501029014,0.7848667118226302,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,3,1,4,0,5,5,4,6.021978021978023,182,255,many people complains plot confusing found simple ninjas sherlock watson former said clever fight minutes film fights solve difficult case bad guy lord blackwood count dracula power minds people cause riots protests everywhere victorian london although bad guy ’ ambitions merely political murders women hobby ’ captured ninjas prosecuted finally hanged many people execution nobody even clever ninja notes rope bad guy hangs stays loose around neck ninja said physician takes pulse corpse directly neck realizes rope ’ leave mark whatsoever dead guy ’ neck admired soft new ropes says nothing declares dead bad guy ’ dead buried big blocks granite hard task blocks actually small pieces glued together lightly bad guy could break inside grave must required quite lot people put fragile blocks place delicately unglue fortunately bad guy working cemetery noticed film goes slowly anything investigate immediately followed long fight often conan doyle writes cases although look supernatural beginning sound rational explanation provided end guy ritchie decides change tedious scheme crescendo built till last frame achieve guy ritchie applies rule case looks supernatural explanation supernatural case end faced magical substances ’ found till even pandora moon like kind clear odorless liquid people take water ignites readily violently spark distilled cyanhydric acid kills much better relatively pure counterpart easy obtain antidote thanks breathe hydrogen cyanide ill effects small sized remote controls made 1880 many many ridicule spared explaining happened display fantasy nothing end clever ninja explain bad guy managed minds people organize riots telepathically maybe magical gas released bad guy caused unfortunately shown film,-0.07656679740013067,0.5683194891528224,0
Sherlock Jr. (1924) - IMDb,"Buster Keaton's most surreal movie sprang from his insistence on logic and realism. His tribute to cinema was inspired by stage magic tricks he remembered from his vaudeville career. His most dazzling and original movie is also one of his least formally perfect. All these paradoxes belong naturally to this ""through the looking glass"" work, which examines the dream-like nature of filmor is it the film-like nature of dreams? As Buster told it, the origin of the film lay in his desire to use certain illusionary stunts, like the bewildering dive through a living assistant's stomach, which he had learned the secret of as a child. But he firmly believed that impossible or ""cartoon"" gags were not acceptable in feature films, so he could only include them by making them occur in a dream, which is also a film-within-a-film. This is odd, when you think about it, since what he seems to be saying is that impossible things can happen in a filmbut this was the very rule he himself refused to break. By creating an outer film that is ""real"" and an inner film that is ""not real,"" Keaton shows that, while film enables illusions and distortions of reality, the filmmaker has a choiceand a responsibilityto clearly delineate fact from fantasy. In one scene, Keaton uses a camera trick (dissolving a wall) to prove that he's NOT using a camera trick when he dives through a window and comes out disguised as an old woman. Because he was analytical, mechanically-minded, and a stickler for authenticity, Keaton took pleasure in revealing the processes of magic tricks, and camera tricks, rather than using them to fool the audience.Buster plays a hapless cinema projectionist who yearns to be a detective, but is so clueless that his romantic rival manages to frame him for stealing his girlfriend's father's watch. In a dream, he enters the film he's projecting and becomes a great detective who solves a similar crime. While Buster's on-screen character is a schlemiel who can only achieve mastery in his celluloid fantasies, as a director Keaton's grasp of the mechanics of film-making enabled him to control the camera and its imagery as thoroughly and gracefully as he controlled his acrobatic body. SHERLOCK JR. is the most technically advanced film he ever made, including special effects (as when Buster steps through the screen and gets edited from park bench to street to mountain-top to lion's den) that can still leave audiences wondering, ""How in hell did he do that?"" It's often said that Keaton's films inspire gasps rather than laughs. Well, I just saw SHERLOCK JR. with an audience last night, and the laughter was loud and regular as fireworks on the Fourth of July. But it's a particular kind of laughter: surprised, amazed, incredulous laughter.The first half of the movie takes place in the ""real"" world; it begins with some nice small-scale gags involving Buster's attempts to scrounge up money to buy candy for his girl, and his adorably awkward visit to her house. After he has been thrown out due to his rival's machinations, Buster ""shadows"" the man (literally, copying his every motion exactly), but is tricked again and trapped in a freight train. There's a beautiful shot where he runs along the top of the train, staying in the same spot on the screen while the cars zoom by under him in the opposite direction; but I can't watch the stunt where he rides a water-spout down to the tracks without wincing, knowing he fractured his neck doing it.The beginning of the dream sequence is one of the greatest self-reflexive scenes in the history of film, as Buster's ghostly double rises from his sleeping body, picks up his ghostly hat, marches down into the theater and steps into the screen. Haven't we all wanted to do this at some time? Once over his turbulent introduction to the medium, Buster becomes the elegant Sherlock, Jr., investigating a theft of pearls from a mansion. In a marvelous game of billiards, Buster smoothly plays around an exploding 13 ball; he escapes from the thieves' den with one of the neatest tricks you'll ever see; he rides through busy streets on the handlebars of a motorcycle that no one is driving; and he goes for a romantic sail in a floating car. All this is packed into a mere 45 minutes.Significantly cut after poor previews, SHERLOCK JR. has more in common with Keaton's short films than his features. Because of the fractured story-line, it doesn't have the narrative coherence or trajectory of character development that most of Keaton's great features do. His performance is split between the shy, inept projectionist and the suave, infallible detective. He is totally convincing in both roles. When he wakes from his dream, the projectionist finds that all is well: the girl has solved the mystery and come to apologize. He is still timid as ever, so for a romantic denouement he looks to the screen: peeking out of his booth, he copies the actions of the movie hero wooing his leading lady. This is Keaton's most trenchant bit of social satire: whose ideas of kissing and love-making haven't been influenced by what they see at the movies?",imogensara_smith13,September/2006,9, Through the

Amitabh Bachan and Dharmendra were awesome too. The character of Hema malini was cheesy n unbelieavable though. A woman riding a horse chariot that too in the cow belt area wher rape is rampant. Nevertheles the film is solid entertainment.

Sicario (2015) - IMDb,"One of those select few thrillers that will have your eyes stuck to the screen from the opening credits to the very end, and I mean that literally: I changed my sitting position many times during the film, yet I clearly recall never ever turning my head away from the film, this is how intense it is.With this Denis Villenueve has now consolidated his name as one of most important and gifted directors of our time and has shown us he is here to stay. I truly marvel at how this film is so tightly put together and even despite it faults, which it has, especially in script, it just never gives you a chance to breathe and take it all in, thanks to the atmosphere that is established from shot one until the last one, you are always anticipating something's going to happen and that is the sign you are watching a great thriller. You are always on the edge of your seat and in some occasions you are really biting your knuckles. The movie has a way to throw you into the action that is really rare to find, especially in a highway sequence where I literally felt I was there.All of this is achieved thanks to probably the best cinematography of this whole year. Deakins does it again, once more playing with a lot of blacks and shadows and once more succeeding one hundred percent. Also remarkable is the use of helicopter shots which don't feel like connective tissue, but actually part of the organic, that's something really hard to pull off. The sound design of this film is flat out amazing, some of the best I have truly ever had the pleasure to experience. It is so in you face, so tight, it really contributes in making you feel a part of this even in the more intimate scenes. Music too is also excellent and while some may say it was a little too ominous and dark I felt it matched the tone perfectly and enhanced some parts magnificently, contributing to a nail-biting building of tension.Of course one couldn't get past reviewing this film without nominating the three great performances at its center. Del Toro, Brolin and Blunt are each better than the other and continue stealing the screen to themselves scene after scene. There really isn't one stand out, the three of them just excel sky high and give depth to characters that are interesting. The characters are really what holds the film together, they are truly developed three dimensionally and explored in depths that aren't normally reached.What makes the film stumble is the fact that in never has a good enough plot to make things as interesting as they should be. It really has a hard time in setting up which way it's going and in the end it actually doesn't end up with a satisfying resolution. You are certainly left with something to think about because of the themes, the characters, the atmosphere and the intensity, but all in all the plot doesn't offer interesting turns and not enough moral questioning, unlike ""Prisoners"", and so remains slightly one-note for the whole duration. It also has a totally useless character in Blunt's partner, which other than never understanding why he was there or what was his arch in the film, I never understood how he was being played.Still there is nothing short of amazing in what Villenueve achieves in two hours.

Sicario (2015) - IMDb,"I was really stoked about Sicario and went to see it the night it opened. Why was I excited? Well, the posters looked cool and I knew that celebrated director Dennis Villeneuve was expected to deliver a fresh and intelligent suspense movie with a nice dose of action.That, plus Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin are in it, and I think they're cool.What I got was a gritty action movie, but unfortunately it wasn't intelligent or thought-provoking. When I'm watching Expendables 3, I'm ready to sit back, enjoy the ride and hold back on the nit-picking. That's not really an option, though, when you have to pay attention to follow the story, and are promised new insights into a deep-rooted problem.*** Spoilers ahead *** I thought it was clever that we see the plot from the perspective of an ingénue, this time in the form of a ""small-time"" FBI agent (Kate Mercer played by Emily Blunt). After her SWAT team storms a horror house run by the Mexican cartels in which two of her fellow officers are killed, she's ready to go after the big guys. Her new CIA-lead team is willing to use ""unconventional"" (read: highly questionable) methods. They extract a drug lord from a Mexican prison and torture him for information. Kate is told that she is there to ""watch and learn"", but ultimately she finds out that she is only there as a goon to legitimize the CIA operating in the homeland. Her function is not to ""watch and learn"" but to shut up, keep out and to sign a paper at the end. For the time being though, the team storms a tunnel used to smuggle drugs across the border in a scene that seems to take a page straight out of Zero Dark Twenty ...*** Spoilers thick on the ground from here on *** Sicario really annoyed me because it brings together so much promise with an incredibly lackluster plot. I feel like I could write an entire book about it. What's the point of the horror house at the beginning? If the cartel is using it to dispose bodies, why would they shrink-wrap the corpses? Why are there gun-toting criminals in a house full of incriminating evidence? Why are the corpses behind dry walls (is the cartel planning on renting out the house)? Why is the trap-door booby-trapped? Why do police have to anticipate that in about six months every further crime scene will be booby-trapped if they don't stop the cartel now? When they are illegally extracting the cartel boss from the Mexican prison, why are they doing it in a highly visible convoy? If they anticipate being ambushed just before the frontier, why don't they keep a lane open? Why didn't they use a helicopter? Why don't they just torture the guy in Mexico? What are the ambushers trying to achieve? What is the role of the crooked cop? Could he be any hammier than carrying a gel bend around that the cartel uses to hold their bankrolls together? And on and on.Five points because of the acting and the cinematography.

Skinwalkers (2006) - IMDb,"Horror fans are idiots.Or at least I think that is what the makers of Skinwalkers must believe. A werewolf movie which makes up its own rules and mythology in order to suit its weak story, and tries to detract from its sheer awfulness with some shoot-outs and a couple of babes, this absolute mess shows complete contempt for fans of the genre.Throwing the audience straight into the middle of a storyline from the outset, director James Isaac confuses viewers for the first 20 minutes, and then spends the rest of the movie's running time dishing up sub-standard lycanthropic hogwash.In Skinwalkers, according to an ancient prophecy (that old chestnut), a half-breed boy will have the power to end the werewolf curse once he reaches the age of thirteen (at the stroke of midnight, of course!). With only days to go before his all important thirteenth birthday, a gang of nasty lycanthropes, who wish to remain as they are, set out to kill the boy. Fortunately for the lad, a small group of good werewolves, who wish to become human again, risk their lives to protect him.Had the makers of this wolfish cack bothered to dish up some decent looking beasts, or perhaps some effective gore, then maybe I would be a little more forgiving.

Skyfall (2012) - IMDb,"As a lifelong James Bond enthusiast who has been extremely disappointed with the franchise's latest efforts (with the exception of Casino Royale), I was extremely pleased with this film. It strayed away from the storyline of the previous two films and I couldn't have been happier after the mediocrity of Quantum of Solace. This film has all the constituents from the Bond films that have preceded it. Big explosions, ridiculous stunts that not a single person in the history of humanity can survive, and let's not forget to mention the beautiful women that would make both genders stop and stare. So what does Skyfall have that the other Bond films don't? For the first time, we get a glimpse into our mysterious hero's dark past. Where he came from and what made him the person he is today. Although I've always been the one to say that Sean Connery is the greatest Bond ever, I can now confess that Daniel Craig now holds that honor. Sean plays the comedic, smooth, and witty Bond to perfection while Daniel plays the mysterious, dark, and lonesome secret agent flawlessly. I will always choose a darker portrayal over a comedic one because it takes a certain mindset to depict someone of that nature. One of my favorite scenes is where Bond is sitting in a bar drinking alone. I don't care who you are or what your background is, if you are drinking by yourself in a bar, then you have issues that are haunting you. Whether you can admit it or not, you are in a dark place and that is exactly where this Daniel Craig portrayed Bond is. And I love it.Aside from Daniel Craig, you have a cast that includes some of the finest actors that have ever graced the big screen. Javier Bardem plays a blood thirsty ex-MI6 agent out for revenge. His performance is equally as creepy and twisted as his portrayal of Anton Chigurh in ""No Country for Old Men"" and it is an Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. Judi Dench reprises her role as M and Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney give important and memorable roles which I won't go further into detail about. Also two prominent figures from James bond history find their way back into the story line. Sam Mendes shows why he was the right choice to direct a film of this magnitude and along with the contribution of Oscar Nominee John Logan, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade come up with a memorable narrative after the disappointment of their last collaborating effort, Quantum of Solace. I look forward to what the future has in store for everyone's favorite spy.

Skyfall (2012) - IMDb,"My 1st review! I was so disgusted with this film&annoyed critics praised it I cracked and had a rant. Numerous Plot holes, contrivances, poor storytelling, character logic&motivation;1. The stolen agent list macguffin; Made famous in M:I then overused in films&TV shows; CharliesAngels2 etc - halfway through the film they just forgot about it2. Hacking magic! Hacking can be done well; goldeneye,swordfish,diehard4...Not just an easy contrived plot device. Can we have a proper explanation &the rules&limitations of Silva's hacking ability in this fiction? For all I know Silva can make satellites fall on people.3. The irony of the 'can Bond operate in an internet world' theme...he failed twice and got M killed...so he can't? 4. How out of place the above theme is; Bond is mature but always current. His a walking encyclopedia (watch the start of any Connery/Moore film). In the last 2 films he was using advanced mobile phone tracking systems...adding hacking does not suddenly make Bond take on the 'modern' age. Are economics or funding civilwars outdated?There was hacking&computers in 1995's Goldeneye..all of a sudden, NOW, there are no more shadows? Did MI6 stop evolving in the late eighties?5.They have a meeting to discuss MI6? This was relevant in Batman, a vigilante was trying to inspire people- It was intertwined in the narrative&theme. Skyfall enquiry was just Sam Mendes ripping off Batman6. Silva's planned capture; Another overused device that was coincidently in Batman. So what did Silva achieve? A conversation with M? When this is revealed shouldn't we look back and have everything make sense? But, NO, I was left wondering why they tried to kill Bond twice in China.7. Why was a hacker in a cell controlled by a computer? Why is Q so stupid he plugged in the laptop to the building? Why was the trap door on the inside of the first glass door? why was there a trap door? How did Silva evade an armed MI6 guard 20 meters from his cell?8. Super calculating (hack crazy)Silva's plan at the end was a firefight? With a backup plan of another firefight?9. So they figured out Silva was dressed as a cop and no-one told anyone? The irony of M defending herself (reading a poem) knowing her own ex agent was about to shoot up the place was lost on critics&writers alike.10. Could Bond not take a Sim free phone or'radio' &call backup when Silva arrived at the end? Instead they had their Home Alone moment- even Macaulay Culkin eventually called the police11. Silva is supposed to mirror Bond. But compare Bond's 'betrayal' to Silva being handed over for torture... Some forced connection is made considering they never met before. Silva tells a story of 2rats so we know what we are supposed to think.12. Bond's betrayal is M ordering Naomi to take a risky shot. Bond later tell's M he heard the order... why didn't he get out the way then? he just kept fighting like an idiot. &did Naomi only have 1 bullet?13.You can't make Bond survive 2 gun shots and a fall like that. His already an established character. The Punisher&Bourne are special BECAUSE they survive. It can't happen to them again mid film/ mid franchise.. 14. Bond follows an assassin&lets him kill innocent people! How is this in his character?! The previous 2 films already rebooted Bond to show WHY he doesn't let innocents die.15. Naomi is a forced character..appearing randomly to remind us she still exists so we can think it's 'clever' when she becomes Moneypenny. Money penny gets demoted from field agent to secretary?!! not even analyst. If she is that hopeless why is she on the most important mission ever? I think Sam Mendes hates women. 16. Bond doesn't even blink when the girl he just bedded a few hours ago gets shot in cold blood. He identifies Severine as being sex trafficked&abused- He then just jumps in her shower. I had little problem with Bond tricking a woman into bed in live and let die- but the sky-fall scene should land him in the S-offenders list. 17.They traced the shrapnel in Bond's chest to a 'special'bullet that only 3 people use? His a 'ghost'...but we have his full flight manifesto. This is how they advanced the plot? wait a minute....didn't that bad guy shoot up half of turkey..? A contrivance& a plot hole in one plot device, that takes some doing.18. One minute he can't shoot...10 seconds later he shoots everyone in a 360 arc? so what happened? oh we are just abandoning that theme mid- se.. 19. Quite a few instances of Bond just standing in front of a landscape shot with his legs apart 'being deep'. I thought he was urinating at first. 20. Q is both a quartermaster&a programmer for the sake of the illogical theme.. but these are completely different skill sets...?21. Knowing all this...what is the list doing in Turkey? on a laptop hardrive? why are only 2-3 agents on the case? They couldn't even do the liberty of making something up for the audience. Imagine Thunderball didn't show how SPECTRE got the nukes...Why couldn't Silva just hack the list? Oh because it isn't connected to the internet you say...but the MI6 heating system is?The script makes no sense, the themes are inappropriate, Bond's character&decision making has been altered &they have confused mature with dinosaur. Die another Day was almost a Bond parody, but this one is simply a mess,&a betrayal of Bond.Shame on critics too impatient to appreciate QoS for not spoon feeding them everything & praising sky-fall because of poorly scattered themes& metaphors on a plot that makes no sense, just because it makes them feel clever",kumar_amit-517-86632131,October/2012,3, So so so bad.

Skyline (2010) - IMDb,"They drop from the sky with no warning. They do seemingly inexplicable things. They are capable of things that defy human experience. And we see it from the perspective of people we have no real connection to.My first thoughts were something like, ""How are K-Fed and Bobby Brown gonna save the planet?"" Turns out, I need not have wondered.What I thought the movie did very well was tell the story from the point of view of a handful of people that have no extraordinary attributes whatsoever. Disaster movies tend to have characters able to overcome improbable odds to somehow accomplish some measure of victory for Earth and/or humanity. Not so in Skyline. We have an apparently successful recording artist living the high life in L.A. and his friend, who possesses some measure of marketing talent. Rounded out with girlfriends, other assorted attractive female hangers-on, and what appears to be one of the security guards of the condominium complex in which the recording artist resides.As far from ""everyday normal"" as this group might seem to be, they could very easily be real people, particularly in La-La Land. And the best part is that they reacted to events in a very normal, everyday human way. Weird stuff happens, and so they try to make sense of it, try to get a look at what's going on. And what they see makes no sense. There are no moments of inspired intuition, no really extraordinary feats of heroism or even ordinary ones.Every plan of action the characters come up with fails, their safe-zones continually diminish, and characters are inexorably picked off. This is mirrored by the larger reaction of the military and their attempts to resist the alien menace. While slightly more successful in causing some injury to the aliens, their ultimate futility is seen when what looks to be an incredibly agile stealth bomber dances and dodges its way through aerial combat to release the Hail-Mary tactical nuke missile even as it is finally shot down. We follow the missile as it tracks toward the largest of alien craft and BOOM! Lots of bright light and big noise, and we see the alien vessel crashing to the ground as a smoldering wreck. Yay! But wait, holy crap, and oh noes! The aliens have regenerative/repair abilities congruent with their clearly organic-machine nature. The actors best moments come when they convey the despair and frustration of seeing every soap-bubble of hope unavoidably popped.Earth is a rich and rare cache of resources presumably not found in many places in the vast, cold reaches of space. The aliens are here to secure their own continued survival with our delicious goodies. Our own species does this exact same thing to plants and animals across the globe. So what more motivation do the aliens need? And how could we realistically resist? None, and we can't, any more than the Amazon or marine life could. I don't know how much more ""real"" the story could get.The movie doesn't satisfy the audience with a heroic victory for mankind. Or any victory, for that matter. And in this, it bucks the seemingly inescapable trend for reassuring us with some message about how adhering to noble virtues will allow us to win out in the end. To me, the film demonstrated exactly how fragile and small we and our planet are in the grander scheme of the universe. It's an ugly, cold truth, and we might prefer to be deluded that we can overcome if we just (add inspiring platitude here). But if our real-life local and global disasters are any indication, those sorts of wins only come at the very end and from the efforts of survivors after the fact. In the scenario this movie presents, we won't get that chance. Were aliens ever to come knocking, humanity as it is now is simply boned. And that's it.Lots of people will not like or want to hear that message from a work of fiction. But I think the makers of this film deserve credit for their much more likely message of futility. It's not something we get a lot of from movies.

Sonatine (1993) - IMDb,"I first wrote a review of this film here on IMDb back in June 2000. At the time I was totally in awe of the film, the script, the acting, the cinematography, the musical score and above all the direction from Tekashi ""Beat"" Kitano.Some 18 months on and I still love the film and is certainly one of my top five international films. I have seen Kitano's latter films, Hana-bi, Brother, Tokyo Eyes & Gonin, and even though production values have improved, especially with Brother and Hana-Bi, I personally feel that Sonatine still remains Beat's best film to date.In retrospect one can see within the film a vision of Beat's state of mind at the time. It is no secret that he tried to commit suicide in real life shortly after the completion of Sonatine. With this in mind it is easy to understand the motive within film and how it is structured within Kitano's head.Even though it is a film about Yakuza and gangland killings Kitano doesn't fill every scene with a running commentary or 100mph action-fests. Instead Sonatine is very much an avante-garde kind of film with the ""action"" taking a backseat to the humdrum lives of the gangsters themselves.Kitano is the boss of a successful Yakuza mob in central Tokyo at the expense of its poorer rivals. As a consequence a plot is hatched to get him and his members on a meaningless trip to Okinawa to sort out a peace-deal between waring factions and thus leaving his ""patch"" vulnerable to a take-over.So Kitano's gang arrive in Okinawa only to find that there is no such ""deal"" but instead his gang are steadily killed off leaving only himself and 3 other gang members and an abandoned young woman, whom he saves from a rape ordeal by her husbandThey move to the coast well away from central Okinawa and wait for the troubles to calm down before considering returning to Tokyo. During that time they have very little to do other than play beach games, sing songs or play Russian Roulette in order to pass the time.But eventually even the beach hut where they live is no longer safe from the assassin's bullet and so Kitano has no other choice but to face his rivals once and for all in a bloody gun battle finale.And so ends the film. It is not a happy film with no satisfying ""Hollywoodesque"" ending. Far from it, the ending only illustrates the working mind of Kitano at the time. In fact there are many examples within the film that underlines the bleak suicidal tendencies of his mind for real, especially the Russian Roulette scene.It is also interesting that these gangsters think nothing of their own lives or safety: they accept their fate as a death-wish. They have witnessed so much death in their lives that they have lost their morality & humanity in themselves and to other people. So it is no surprise that during the various gun battles between rival groups neither Kitano or his men hide behind furniture in order to avoid the bullets. Instead they stand erect like statues firing their guns, hoping for the best waiting to be killed by their enemy in full view.The life of the Yakuza in the context of this film, therefore, counts for little. They have no life, only a limited existence. There are few highlights - such as the Sumo scene, the firework fight and even the scene where Aya Kokumai removes her t-shirt in front of Kitano so that she is semi-nude before him. And yet not even this makes an impression on him. He is has become such an empty shell that even his sensual nature has long since gone, such is the life of a Yakuza warlord.Critics would argue that this film is too anal for its own good, that nothing much happens and that the film is punctuated with ""to camera"" shots of the main protagonists looking vacant at the audience waiting for something to happen.In my opinion these critics miss the point. There is a reason why they stare back at the camera/audience. There is no sparkle in their eyes, no smile playing on their lips, no supple skin tone, no positive body language to tell us that these people are really happy. Instead, we see nothing but ghosts, empty husks of humanity awaiting their fate with the silver bullet; they look at us as if they are pleading with us to put them out of their sad existence. They may have guns, the money, the power but they are not happy, they are not content, they are not you and me!Sonatine remains one of the most influential films ever to come out of Japan. So impressed was I with this film that I created this IMDb login in honour of its majesty. Yes, it maybe seen as a sad act to name a login after a film but for me Tekeshi Kitano has yet to direct a better film and Sonatine will haunt me for all sorts of reasons for years to come, especially the excellent score from Joe Hisaishi.*****/*****",Sonatine973,January/2002,9, Sonatine Revisited,1,"[first, write, review, film, imdb, back, june, time, totally, awe, film, script, act, cinematography, musical, score, direction, tekashi, beat, month, still, love, film, certainly, one, top, five, international, film, see, kitano, latter, film, brother, tokyo, eye, gonin, even, though, production, value, improve, especially, brother, personally, feel, sonatine, still, remains, beat, best, film, retrospect, one, see, within, film, vision, beat, state, mind, time, secret, try, commit, suicide, real, life, shortly, completion, sonatine, mind, easy, understand, motive, within, film, structure, within, kitano, though, film, yakuza, gangland, killing, kitano, fill, every, scene, run, commentary, instead, sonatine, much, kind, film, action, take, backseat, humdrum, ...]","[i first, wrote, a review, of, this film, here, on, imdb, back, in, june, at, the time i, was, totally, in, awe, of, the film, the script, the acting, the cinematography, the musical score, above, all the direction, from, tekashi, beat, kitano.some, 18 months, on, i, still, love, the film, is, certainly, of, my, top, five international films, i, have seen, kitano, latter films, hana-bi, brother, tokyo eyes & gonin, even, though, production values, have improved, especially, with, brother, hana-bi, i, personally feel, that, sonatine, still remains beat, best film, to, date.in, retrospect one, can see, within, film, a vision, beat, state, of, mind, at, the time, it, is, no secret, that, he, tried, to, commit, suicide, in, real life, shortly, after, the completion, of, sonatine, with, this in mind it, is, easy, to, understand, the motive, within, film, ...]",286.51596877144766,2.8035047490142753,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,1,2,1,4,2,3,1,0,3,2,0,5.690972222222222,288,422,first wrote review film imdb june 2000 time totally awe film script acting cinematography musical score direction tekashi beat kitano 18 months still love film certainly top international films seen kitanos latter films hana bi brother tokyo eyes gonin even though production values improved especially brother hana bi personally feel sonatine still remains beats best film date retrospect within film vision beats state mind time secret tried commit suicide real life shortly completion sonatine mind easy understand motive within film structured within kitanos head even though film yakuza gangland killings kitano fill every scene running commentary 100mph action fests instead sonatine much avante garde kind film action taking backseat humdrum lives gangsters kitano boss successful yakuza mob central tokyo expense poorer rivals consequence plot hatched members meaningless trip okinawa sort peace deal waring factions thus leaving patch vulnerable take kitanos gang arrive okinawa deal instead gang steadily killed leaving 3 gang members abandoned young woman saves rape ordeal husbandthey move coast well away central okinawa wait troubles calm considering returning tokyo time little play beach games sing songs play russian roulette order pass time eventually even beach hut live longer safe assassins bullet kitano choice face rivals bloody gun battle finale ends film happy film satisfying hollywoodesque ending far ending illustrates working mind kitano time fact many examples within film underlines bleak suicidal tendencies mind real especially russian roulette scene interesting gangsters think nothing lives safety accept fate death wish witnessed much death lives lost morality humanity people surprise various gun battles rival groups neither kitano men hide behind furniture order avoid bullets instead stand erect like statues firing guns hoping best waiting killed enemy full view life yakuza context film therefore counts little life limited existence highlights sumo scene firework fight even scene aya kokumai removes shirt front kitano semi nude yet even makes impression become empty shell even sensual nature long since gone life yakuza warlord critics would argue film anal good nothing much happens film punctuated camera shots main protagonists looking vacant audience waiting something happen opinion critics miss point reason stare camera audience sparkle eyes smile playing lips supple skin tone positive body language us people really happy instead nothing ghosts empty husks humanity awaiting fate silver bullet look us pleading us put sad existence may guns money power happy content sonatine remains influential films ever japan impressed film created imdb login honour majesty yes maybe seen sad act name login film tekeshi kitano yet direct better film sonatine haunt sorts reasons years especially excellent score joe hisaishi,0.15424139352710783,0.5029890744176458,1

Species II (1998) - IMDb,"The people who are stating that this movie is the worst sequel they've ever seen obviously never saw ""Hercules II"" or ""Jaws 3-D"" or ""Hellraiser II"". Now, I am not about to tell you that this is a great film, but if you set your expectations low, you are likely to have fun.

Michael Madsen understood that, to be sure, and thanks to his trademarked coolness, he walks away with the picture. As for Natasha Henstridge, she has more or less a supporting part, but one that is rather imaginatively linked to the central story line.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) - IMDb,"I have to say, and no pun-intended: Into the Spider-Verse is a total marvel, all the way down to its stylish and diverse styles of animation to its bold, sophisticated storytelling. The visuals are absolutely enchanting. Fast, colorful, and distinct. Something Sony Animation always nails is how each character has a pronounced look and movement. With the various kinds of Spider-Men and Marvel villains featured in this story, the animators went all out to give them a unique identity. Notably in this case are Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham. Noir, whose universe takes place in 1930s New York, boasts a dark, shadowy vibe similar to Sin City, Peni Parker has a bubbly anime look, and Spider-Ham is a bouncy, eccentric cartoon character who takes full advantage of his absurd existence to deliver some of the film's best laughs. Even with these different identities, the film slows down to balance their character in a serious nature. Heck, one of the most hard-hitting, poignant lines is spoken by Spider-Ham, the breakout comedic relief.Miles and a majority of characters share the same art style. I really enjoy the blend of 3D models with traditional 2D movement. It's very appealing to watch and it seamlessly matches the comic book theme. I also appreciate the stylization of certain villains. Kingpin is a character I don't think was portrayed accurately outside of the comics, just appearing as a generic, heavy-set bald brute, when he's really an enormous, borderline non-human tank. Kingpin looks excellent in this film, with his titanic body and small head with an intimidating grimace. He's a powerful force and a legitimately scary antagonist. Doc Ock is another example, portrayed as a brilliant, but outlandish female scientist with a psychotic passion for villainy. I didn't feel like I needed to know more about her character, she was such a fun villainess to watch. She really added to the suspense in some action sequences.I really loved the story. I thought it was rich with charm and thrills. Granted, I did notice some familiar elements that are done to death in superhero fiction and the animation canon alike, such as surprise villain reveals and major character deaths that were obviously seen coming, and I certainly wish some characters (espeically Miles' uncle) had more screentime, but there's one fact that overshadows these flaws for me: The writing is mature. First of all, it's a Sony Animation product. If you look at this company's past work, some of it is very soulless with its marketing and panders to its audience with incessant pop culture references and juvenile comedy. Into the Spider-Verse is a welcome departure. Passion and integrity was put into this project. The writing is very grounded and treats its audience like people who want to see a genuinely captivating flick. Heck, the first third of the film is somewhat slow and nonchalant, almost like an arthouse film. I've never had such a cool, yet off-beat and engaged feeling while watching an animated film on the big screen. Nothing was forced, nothing felt out-of-place, nothing took me out of immersion. The tone and pacing is very adult, even when something excessively goofy like Spider-Ham is on-screen. It's like the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It can be dark and distressing, but lighthearted and amusing. There's a perfect balance and it never sacrifices integrity just to appeal to a niche audience. Well...there is that after-credits scene, but it was quite hilarious, so I let it pass.That's the most I can say without spoiling a lot of the film. I want you to see this absolute marvel with your own eyes. To close, Into the Spider-Verse is everything I hoped it would be. This is a game-changer for both superhero filmmaking and animation altogether. Sleek, colorful, funny, emotional, frenetic. This film skillfully balances all these elements. There is never a moment that felt forced, it never talks down to the audience. It's a mature and stylish take on the Spider-Man mythos, and perhaps the best big-screen Spidey picture to date with some of the best animated visuals you'll ever see. I didn't have a single issue with this film. I was dazzled and moved throughout. Sony Animation, if this was your apology for The Emoji Movie, then apology goddamn accepted.

Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams (2002) - IMDb,"After enjoying some success with the surprisingly enjoyable & cheesy ""Spy Kids,""  Director (and all around good guy) Robert Rodriguez now brings forth a sequel, ""Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams"" which is far less enjoyable and far more cheesy.   As a matter of fact, you'd be hard pressed to find more cheese anywhere outside of a Wisconsin dairy farm.Juni and Carmen Cortez (Daryl Sabara and Alexa Vega) are back, now officially a part of OSS, and officially recognized as Spy Kids.  But the OSS, just like every other government bureaucracy, cannot resist expanding upon a good thing, so now there is an entire army of ""spy kids"" at their disposal; but Juni and Carmen are, of course, the most renowned. 
Within in the first opening minutes of the film, which takes place in a truly inspired theme park, we quickly discern that Juni and Carmen have rivals: the Giggle kids (Matthew O'Leary and Emily Osment) who dearly covet the Cortez' fame and status.  With help of their conniving father (Mike Judge), the Giggles do what they can, not only to surpass the Cortez family, but to humiliate them as well.Once again, we find the greatest threat to the OSS is the OSS itself, along with the internal politics and treachery which played a small but significant part in the plot of the first film.   It seems as if the OSS is more of a threat to world peace than a help, and one wonders why Uncle Sam doesn't just shut the operation down and call it a day.  Perhaps it would prevent the making of any more ""Spy Kids"" movies, which I'm beginning to think would be a very good thing.The plot revolves around a device known as a ""transmooker""  -- which can be best described as the ultimate cloaking device, even able to cloak entire islands off the map.  It also has the wonderful ability to render all electronic devices useless, which is quite a thorn in the side of the intrepid Spy Kids, who's reliance on James Bond style fancy gadgets is only a shade less than an alcoholic's dependence on his next drink.  Of course the transmooker itself is an electronic device, but somehow is immune to its own nasty effects.  (Only in Hollywood....)So our two heroes, Juni and Carmen, locate the cloaked island, where the stolen transmooker was taken, and attempt to find it before their rivals, the Giggles kids, do.  The island turns out to be a retirement resort for every single monstrous creature ever created by Ray Harryhausen (""Jason and the Argonauts,"" ""7th Voyage of Sinbad,"" etc.).  Except we are told that they were created by the socially insecure and somewhat troubled scientist ""Dr. Romero"" (Steve Buscemi) who was looking for some companionship, and a portable zoo.  But of course those of us who've seen a few movies in our time know better.  During the same time, there is a completely boring and totally unnecessary sub-plot involving Carmen & Juni's parents and grandparents.  The only reason the subplot exists is to cloak this poor homage to Harryhausen as a ""family film.""  Yeah, right.  I certainly fell for it.Hollywood films, especially action-adventures and sci-fi flicks, often  ask the audience to suspend logic and rational thought while the plot thickens. It is the price we pay, beyond the ticket price, for the pleasure of being ""entertained.""  But Spy Kids 2 doesn't just ask for a suspension of belief, but a wholesale slaughter of anything remotely resembling intelligence. That's a big price to pay, and one I was unable to justify. 
If Daniel Rodriguiez is such a fan of Harryhausen, then he should make ""The 8th Voyage of Sinbad"" or some such thing, rather than trying to find a way to incorporate Ray's creatures into a movie allegedly about espionage.  The CGI recreations of Harryhausen's monsters was one of the more enjoyable aspects of this horrid film, but not enough to pull it out of the slimy pit in which very poor writing knocks it into.  The dialogue is stupid, even for kids to listen to.  Most of the jokes fall as flat as the acting.   Much of the cuteness and fun of the first Spy Kids film is completely lacking in the sequel.  Instead, we have a very disjointed plot, an adventure that leads to nowhere, and a subplot that should have been locked in the submarine where it mostly takes place.

Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over (2003) - IMDb,"There's little denying that the Spy Kids series wasn't brilliant. Far better kids' films have been made. Though I must admit, I have enjoyed them. They have proved to be extremely flexible with mediocre budgets and are extremely fun to watch. And Spy Kids 3-D brings you into the experience - anything in 3-D is brilliant, but I found this an overwhelming cinematic experience with the 3-D glasses. This may explain why Spy Kids 3-D did well at the box office. Although, saying that, the only really good thing is the cinematic experience. This film does have substance enough to keep you watching through the whole thing, but there's no denying that it lacks on the intelligence and is once again, a predictable affair. And there's no character development either - didn't either of the Spy Kids learn anything from their encounters in the game? There really isn't much to warrant a DVD purchase - though you can still view it in 3D on the TV, a lot of the experience is lost in the translation.

Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over (2003) - IMDb,"What a mess. There are clever ideas here and there, a few laughs, the occasional decent special effect (I saw this on TV so didn't see it in 3D, which perhaps would have made the generally disappointing effects more impressive), but the lame, tossed-together script and the lack of any cohesion to the final product make this only barely watchable. This movie seems to just be going through the motions; you can't even call it formulaic because it barely attempts to even stick with any formula, it's more like random stuff thrown in here and there. As for the ending, well, it's main purpose was to create an excuse (and not a very good one) to have cameos by everyone who was in the first two movies (allowing them to list Bandaras first in the credits even though he's on screen for only a couple of minutes), and the final showdown is so utterly moronic that words fail me.At the same time, I didn't actually hate it. I wasn't in pain watching it. It was a mindless Saturday afternoon movie and I watched it as mindlessly as I could and occasionally enjoyed it.

Star Trek (2009) - IMDb,"Star Trek. When someone speaks this name, various images, ideas, characters and phrases come to mind. I know they certainly do with me. Characters such as Kirk, Spock, Picard, Data, Janeway, Seven of Nine; ideas like the prime directive; phrases like ""Live long and Prosper"", ""Good God Jim, I'm a doctor not a."". I wouldn't consider myself a ""Trekkie"", but I do have a deep affection for this series and world.To my great delight, I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening last night of JJ Abrams re-imaging of ""Star Trek"". I must admit that I was skeptical at first about taking such iconic characters and recasting them, even in younger iterations, because most people think of the characters of Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and Chekov with the actors that originally portrayed them. These portrayals are engrained in the pop culture consciousness of the world and hence my skepticism arose. Fortunately, my doubts were unnecessary.This is not your father's ""Star Trek"". From the moment the movie begins, so does the action and it never lets up. However, this movie has more than just incredible and intense action, it also pays homage to the series of old. Sure, they wanted to bring us a Trek for the 21st century, but they also realized that they needed to respect the source material and fans of a series that has been around more than 40 years. However, you don't need to know much about Star Trek to enjoy this movie. Each character has been given a background and history that lets you know a little something about each one. There's a lot to be told in an origin movie and it is handled deftly by both the writers and the director.But, what really made the movies for me were the actors chosen to play these roles, especially Chris Pine as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock and Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy, aka ""Bones"". This movie would not have worked if the casting of these three characters had not been spot on. Both Mr. Quinto and Urban uncannily channel their predecessors, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley. They took on some of their inflections, mannerisms and expressions to really give you a sense that they are just younger versions of the originals. Chris Pine, however, takes on the most memorable role in Trek history and makes it his own. This Kirk is not only the womanizer, lover, and captain that you already know, but as portrayed by Mr. Pine also has a swagger, bravado, intelligence, and is a complete adrenaline junkie. We could not have asked for a better Kirk in this movie.They have laid a solid foundation for a new series, with new life, perfect cast and a director with a true vision. If the first movie can be this good, my expectations for further adventures have risen exponentially.This is my first review for our website and as such might not be very good since I have no experience at writing reviews. I intentionally didn't reveal any plot points so as to not spoil anything for whoever may read this. I may in the future reveal areas that may have spoilers but mark these sections so you can skip over them. I'll be seeing Wolverine tomorrow and hope to have a review up by tomorrow night.

Star Trek (2009) - IMDb,"After the recently terrible James Bond film, and the equally terrible ending to the Bourne trilogy, it appears that the ""wobbly camera"" disease has spread to another franchise with similar results. There appears to be a direct correlation between the rate of camera wobble and the ""pace"" of the action scene being shot. We all know that this camera wobble is artificial and often done during editing and special effect overlay, but the outcome is the same and it is unwatchable. It appears to me to be a ""technique"" used today in many films to prevent the audience clearly seeing the shot, the special effects and the action occurring. Possibly because the audience would see mismatches between the special effects, the action being overlaid and the poor quality stunt work. I gave this film a rating of one out of ten principally because the wobbly camera technique is something we now see in many films, particularly films with large amounts of special effects and it is cheating the audience out of the opportunity to see if the shot actually flows and to observe how the special effects are melded to the shot and the action. Do we really want to come away from every film thinking we have been in a small boat in a rough swell? I certainly don't and I now add JJ Abrams to the list of Marc Forster who created the worst Bond film of all time with ""jiggle camera"" and Paul Greengrass who destroyed the Bourne Trilogy with ""shaky camera"". Hang your head in shame, this trio had the opportunity to make great films, each carrying their franchise forward and each in turn has been unable to achieve an outcome without the use of ""shaky camera"", which is an automatic turnoff for the audience.",mgregory-911,May/2009,1, Wobbly camera strikes again,0,"[recently, terrible, james, bond, film, equally, terrible, end, bourne, trilogy, appears, wobbly, camera, disease, spread, another, franchise, similar, result, appears, direct, correlation, rate, camera, wobble, pace, action, scene, shot, know, camera, wobble, artificial, often, do, edit, special, effect, overlay, outcome, unwatchable, appears, technique, use, today, many, film, prevent, audience, clearly, see, shot, special, effect, action, occur, possibly, audience, would, see, mismatch, special, effect, action, overlaid, poor, quality, stunt, work, give, film, rating, one, ten, principally, wobbly, camera, technique, something, see, many, film, particularly, film, large, amount, special, effect, cheat, audience, opportunity, see, shot, actually, flow, observe, special, effect, meld, shot, ...]","[after, the recently terrible james bond, film, the equally terrible ending, to, the bourne trilogy, it, appears, that, wobbly camera, disease, has, spread, to, another franchise, with, similar results, appears, to, be, a direct correlation, between, the rate, of, camera wobble, pace, of, the action scene, being, shot, we, know, that, this camera wobble, is, artificial, often done, during, editing and special effect overlay, the outcome, is, same, it, is, unwatchable, it, appears, to, me, to, be, technique, used, today, in, many films, to, prevent, the audience, clearly seeing, the shot, the special effects, the action, occurring, possibly, because, the audience, would see, mismatches, between, the special effects, the action, being overlaid, the poor quality stunt work, i, gave, film, a rating, of, out of, principally, because, the wobbly camera technique, is something, we, now see, in, many films, particularly films, with, large amounts, of, special effects, it, is cheating, the audience, out of, the opportunity, to, see, ...]",-42.65334004434915,8.4965110438886,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,3,2,0,0,4,4,0,2,0,4,4,2,5.9230769230769225,104,149,recently terrible james bond film equally terrible ending bourne trilogy appears wobbly camera disease spread another franchise similar results appears direct correlation rate camera wobble pace action scene shot know camera wobble artificial often done editing special effect overlay outcome unwatchable appears technique used today many films prevent audience clearly seeing shot special effects action occurring possibly audience would mismatches special effects action overlaid poor quality stunt work gave film rating ten principally wobbly camera technique something many films particularly films large amounts special effects cheating audience opportunity shot actually flows observe special effects melded shot action really want away every film thinking small boat rough swell certainly add jj abrams list marc forster created worst bond film time jiggle camera paul greengrass destroyed bourne trilogy shaky camera hang head shame trio opportunity great films carrying franchise forward turn unable achieve outcome without use shaky camera automatic turnoff audience,-0.016741071428571418,0.49136904761904754,0
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) - IMDb,"Wrath is based on one of the best episodes of The Original Series of Star Trek.  The episode, Space Seed, introduced Kahn Noonian Singh, a genetically engineered super-warrior from the 20th century who survived in cryogenic freeze until the crew of the Enterprise found his derelict space ship and revived him.  Alas, his instinct to conquer survived as well, and only after an epic struggle is Kirk able to deposit Kahn and his band of supermen in permanent exile on a garden planet.Fifteen years later, a cataclysm has left that planet barren, and Kahn bitter about his plight, when along comes the Enterprise, not knowing they have returned to Kahn's home planet.  Kahn escapes and the game is on.This is undoubtedly the best of the Star Trek movies, and in fact, the best of everything that was best about Star Trek TOS.  There is heroism, epic conflict, a fully satisfying story, and deliciously over the top acting by Shatner, Nimoy and, the main course, Ricardo Montalban, reprising his original role, with all the menace and drama of, say, Sir Anthony Hopkins' Oscar winning turn as Hannibal Lechter.The writing is great, and why not, it was by Harve Bennett, by way of Melville, and Roddenberry's unforgettable characters, as indelibly etched on our psyches as any fairy tale of our youth, were never brighter, more heroic, more magnificent.  In the genre, there is simply nothing better, and there never will be.  It took decades to hone and refine these characters, for us to come to love them, and for them to reach the point in their palpably real lives to reflect with self-doubt and angst on lives that we accept as being as real as our own.

Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) - IMDb,"Star Trek Into Darkness should be renamed Star Trek In Name Only. What has always distinguished Star Trek from other sci-fi is the thoughtful and nuanced way that philosophical and sociological commentary was woven into the stories. Star Trek is not just a lot of sci-fi nonsense but a meaningful exploration of what it means to be human. In the past, Star Trek has been intelligent and character driven. Now it is all fancy CGI and snappy one-liners. Abram's Star Trek is an action-for-action's sake Kirk and Spock buddy flick. The ""surprises"" Abrams plants aren't surprises if you're familiar with the Star Trek universe. His preference for violence and political intrigue makes Abrams' vision more Star Wars than Star Trek.The fill-in-the-blanks plot is a repetitive onslaught of video-game like CGI sequences separated by brief breaks used to set up the next CGI spectacle. The first half begins with a scene taken from Raiders of the Lost Ark and quickly moves to The Return of the King's Mount Doom. Cumberbatch's attack on Starfleet HQ is a scene stolen from Godfather 3. When Cumberbatch is captured, he and Pine briefly become caricatures of Hannibal Lecter and Agent Starling from Silence of the Lambs. The second half attempts to remake The Wrath of Khan but is backwards and upside down. Instead it is practically a beat-for-beat repeat of the identically plotted Star Trek Nemesis.The cast was the best thing about the last movie but not this time. The other familiar crew members each get a brief moment in the spotlight but for the most part they fixate on comedic asides. The romance between Uhura and Spock is unnecessary and actually diminishes Uhura's character. Alice Eve is little more than eye candy. Peter Weller's Admiral Marcus is a disappointment.

Star Trek: First Contact (1996) - IMDb,"Let's face it: Picard's generation aren't made for the action-smash movie set. They don't fit with it. Kirk and company were made for brash brawling and gunning down Khan and the Klingons, which made for great movies that were true to the original series; Picard's series dwelt on the more cerebral affairs of diplomacy, temporal paradoxes and altered realities. The higher-concept stuff of Star Trek: The Next Generation doesn't feel right squished into a movie setting, where flashy explosions and high energy levels are expected. ""First Contact"" is a good action/sci-fi flick - but it takes one of TNG's better sci-fi concepts and trashes it in the name of marketability.Yes, ""First Contact"" has great action sequences - the zero-g fight, the weird radioactive gas thing in the end, even the delightfully kitchy holodek mobster fight. The plot on earth works wonders simply because of James Cromwell's portrayal of Zephram Cochrane - his character and his story are compelling. And Picard's ""Ahab Syndrome"" was pretty sweet too.The problem in this movie is the Borg - and more specifically, with the introduction of a ""Borg Queen."" The reason why the Borg are so frightening in the Next Generation TV series was not merely because they were powerful, but because they were so incredibly alien: they were a race in which no individuals exist. The Borg are not a ""hive of drones"" who are ruled by a ""queen""; they are a single mind spread throughout billions upon billions of bodies. A single Borg is not akin to a drone in a hive, which has an individual nature but which is oppressed in a rigid hierarchy; rather, it is akin to a cell in an organism - it has no free, meaningful, or distinct existence beyond the larger body. There is no head or ""ruler"" of the Borg, any more than there is a single cell in your body that governs what you do. What makes the Borg's outlook on the rest of the universe so disturbing is that they cannot comprehend individuality, and thus individual lives are utterly insignificant to them... they take life without compunction because to the Borg, they aren't really taking lives - killing a human is like scraping a cell off someone's skin, an inconsequential act. The Borg are a truly alien species with a completely alien mindset - a rare gem in mainstream sci-fi.But ""First Contact"" gives them a Queen who struts around and acts for all the world like a nasty human in some expensive makeup. She exchanges quips with Picard. She drips sexual innuendo over Data. She acts more like a James Bond temptress than a member of an alien cybernetic overmind. It completely demystifies them, makes them more human, when what made them so compelling is that they are so completely inhuman.Without the Borg Queen, this movie would have perhaps been less approachable to casual moviegoers - after all, most expect their villains to have a face they can react to, and the Borg are nothing if not faceless - but it would have kept the Borg at their chilling and pure best. Instead, ""First Contact"" waters down Next Generation's brilliance and replaces it with some smirking one-liners and a lot of stuff that gets blown up.6/10",Captain,Kite2/November,5, good action movie - not a good Next Gen movie,0,"[let, u, face, picard, generation, make, movie, set, fit, kirk, company, make, brash, brawling, gun, khan, klingons, make, great, movie, true, original, series, picard, series, dwelt, cerebral, affair, diplomacy, temporal, paradox, alter, reality, stuff, star, trek, next, generation, feel, right, squish, movie, set, flashy, explosion, high, energy, level, expect, first, contact, good, flick, take, one, tng, better, concept, trash, name, first, contact, great, action, sequence, fight, weird, radioactive, gas, thing, end, even, delightfully, kitchy, holodek, mobster, fight, plot, earth, work, wonder, simply, james, cromwell, portrayal, zephram, cochrane, character, story, compelling, picard, ahab, syndrome, pretty, sweet, problem, movie, borg, specifically, introduction, ...]","[let, us, face, it, picard, generation, are not made, for, the action-smash movie, set, they, do not fit, with, it, kirk and company, were made, for, brash brawling, gunning, down, the klingons, made, for, great movies, were, true, to, the original series, picard, series, dwelt, on, the more cerebral affairs, of, diplomacy, temporal paradoxes, altered, realities, the higher-concept stuff, of, star trek, the next generation, does not feel, right, squished, into, a movie, setting, where, flashy explosions, high energy levels, are expected, first contact, is, a good action/sci-fi flick, it, takes, of, tng, better sci-fi concepts, trashes it, in, the name, of, marketability.yes, first contact, has, great action sequences, the zero-g fight, the weird radioactive gas thing, in, the end, even, the delightfully kitchy holodek mobster fight, the plot, on, earth works wonders, simply, because of, james, cromwell, portrayal, of, zephram cochrane, his character and his story, are, compelling, picard, ahab syndrome, was, pretty sweet too.the problem, in, this movie, is, the borg, more specifically, with, the introduction, of, borg queen, ...]",126.7065585650212,-0.7898101859105355,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,1,1,4,0,5,5,4,6.044117647058822,204,286,let us face picards generation made action smash movie set fit kirk company made brash brawling gunning khan klingons made great movies true original series picards series dwelt cerebral affairs diplomacy temporal paradoxes altered realities higher concept stuff star trek next generation feel right squished movie setting flashy explosions high energy levels expected first contact good action sci fi flick takes tngs better sci fi concepts trashes name marketability yes first contact great action sequences g fight weird radioactive gas thing end even delightfully kitchy holodek mobster fight plot earth works wonders simply james cromwells portrayal zephram cochrane character story compelling picards ahab syndrome pretty sweet problem movie borg specifically introduction borg queen reason borg frightening next generation tv series merely powerful incredibly alien race individuals exist borg hive drones ruled queen single mind spread throughout billions upon billions bodies single borg akin drone hive individual nature oppressed rigid hierarchy rather akin cell organism free meaningful distinct existence beyond larger body head ruler borg single cell body governs makes borgs outlook rest universe disturbing comprehend individuality thus individual lives utterly insignificant take life without compunction borg really taking lives killing human like scraping cell someones skin inconsequential act borg truly alien species completely alien mindset rare gem mainstream sci fi first contact gives queen struts around acts world like nasty human expensive makeup exchanges quips picard drips sexual innuendo data acts like james bond temptress member alien cybernetic overmind completely demystifies makes human made compelling completely inhuman without borg queen movie would perhaps less approachable casual moviegoers expect villains face react borg nothing faceless would kept borg chilling pure best instead first contact waters next generations brilliance replaces smirking liners lot stuff gets blown 6 10,0.0944201228878648,0.5213824884792626,1
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) - IMDb,"May 19, 2005 was not a simple day for fans and fans of the ""Star Wars"". It was a day when all pieces of history fell into place, finally opening a riddle that lasted more than 28 years. People imagined and thought out, wrote books and stories, collected facts and made legends, and everything for the sake of one saga, which will forever remain in the hearts of its admirers. Probably, almost every person, leaving the hall, could not convey or describe in words, what happened during these several hours in the cinema. Joyful, sad, tearful, shocked faces, slowly headed for the exit, promising to come back and see this episode again.This is the chapter of history, truly the most intense and the most powerful. It penetrates into the lungs, not allowing to breathe, touching hearts and souls. We are just spectators. But we can experience. And at some point, there is only a doomed sigh, realizing that there is no way out.Indeed, the third episode is the most cruel and tragic. There is much more pain and despair in it than in any other part. Here the republic collapses like a house of cards, turning into an empire, the Jedi perish at the hands of their ""single minded"", and the face of Anakin Skywalker forever hides the black helmet of Darth Vader. And all this inspires horror, the horror of hopelessness, when you slowly begin to understand that all this is only part of the plan, the way of a petty senator to a ruthless emperor, where everyone is just a pawn, in a huge game of the big world. And every word said accidentally becomes the key to this great puzzle, which accompanies the imperial march. But when you realize it, it's too late.""I swear the faithfulness of your teachings,"" whispers the future dark lord to his master with despair and devotion, asking only one thing - to save her beloved. At this moment Anakin Skywalker perishes, dies together with the republic, along with the Jedi, together with her beloved, giving birth to Darth Vader - the future tyrant, which inspires terror and fear, driven by hatred and despair, in the eyes of which something like love is reflected ...
And the most terrible thing was that it was inevitable. The Jedi themselves dug themselves a pit, while the enemy stood behind them, alternately, pushing them down. This is war. Order 66. The army of clones. Padmé Anakin. Alone, these errors are not so significant, but together they form a whole madness and panic, in one hour destroying everything that the galaxy has been working on for many millennia. Therefore here the absolute evil and absolute good unite in the struggle, this cinema and consists of some contrasts. Good and bad, the Jedi and the Sith, Obi-Wan and Anakin, the emperor and Yoda, Anakin and Padmé.Such a controversial character went to Hayden Cristian. In essence, he plays two opposites in one body. Nobility and sincerity at the beginning and anger and hatred in the end. And all fear began, which slowly grew into panic, then into despair, anger, getting to hatred. It was thanks to fear that the emperor firmly grabbed Anakin's soul, not wanting to let go of his new servant. The glitter of embittered eyes, in which hatred for everything and the thirst for power breathe. It is difficult to imagine someone who could better cope with this task. Therefore, there are no more words left than one: ""I believe"".It's all over, Anakin. I'm above you!The battle of Obi-Wan and Skywalker is what remains in memory forever. This is not just a battle between two people who have spent together their whole lives, this is a battle between two brothers who sacrificed their lives for each other's sake. Here, the side and skills of each are determined. Obi-Wan (in the brilliant, by the way, performance of Evan McGregor) does not try to follow the easy ways to achieve his goals. He goes to Mustafar, he understands with bitterness what is going on. Therefore, this battle is not only with the darkness, it is a battle with yourself, with your feelings and attachments. Unlike Anakin, Obi-Wan is firmly committed to duty, goals, order. For some reason, he is sorry for the most in the end. A person who, in any situation, acted as correctly, and not as easily.
At the same time, we see the battle of two other opposites. Yoda and the emperor. Here, the battle goes for other concepts, for democracy, peace and freedom. The fate of the entire galaxy is being decided. And as the swords are crossed, good and evil are constantly side by side, weaving and maintaining the balance of power, crossing swords, but achieving different goals.But where did it start? Padmé Amidala, without knowing it herself, is the center of the whole string and culmination that unfolds during these few hours. A tragic figure that unwittingly became the key to the empire, from which they simply got rid of unnecessarily. Natalie Portman, like no other, fits into a gloomy sweep and the helpless panic that reigns around. Her heroine is touching and ardent, but unable to change anything, she is only an outside observer of the war and the collapse of the republic.Painful and sad ...Most of the attention of the film is given to Anakin, whose fear and sweeping increasingly turns him into the ruler of the Sith. However, about the persecution of General Grievous, powerful battles and amazing planets, also did not forget. This is a movie that will not leave anyone indifferent. Yes, and whether to restrain feelings? After all, this legend, which will be remembered.Bravo George Lucas.The highest ball.",BiiivAL5,June/2018,9, This is war,1,,,348.46801291248636,-11.825605276525788,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,1,2,3,4,2,4,3,0,3,3,3,5.982035928143714,334,466,may 19 2005 simple day fans fans star wars day pieces history fell place finally opening riddle lasted 28 years people imagined thought wrote books stories collected facts made legends everything sake saga forever remain hearts admirers probably almost every person leaving hall could convey describe words happened several hours cinema joyful sad tearful shocked faces slowly headed exit promising episode chapter history truly intense powerful penetrates lungs allowing breathe touching hearts souls spectators experience point doomed sigh realizing way indeed third episode cruel tragic much pain despair part republic collapses like house cards turning empire jedi perish hands single minded face anakin skywalker forever hides black helmet darth vader inspires horror horror hopelessness slowly begin understand part plan way petty senator ruthless emperor everyone pawn huge game big world every word said accidentally becomes key great puzzle accompanies imperial march realize late swear faithfulness teachings whispers future dark lord master despair devotion asking thing save beloved moment anakin skywalker perishes dies together republic along jedi together beloved giving birth darth vader future tyrant inspires terror fear driven hatred despair eyes something like love reflected terrible thing inevitable jedi dug pit enemy stood behind alternately pushing war order 66 army clones padmé anakin alone errors significant together form whole madness panic hour destroying everything galaxy working many millennia therefore absolute evil absolute good unite struggle cinema consists contrasts good bad jedi sith obi wan anakin emperor yoda anakin padmé controversial character went hayden cristian essence plays opposites body nobility sincerity beginning anger hatred end fear began slowly grew panic despair anger getting hatred thanks fear emperor firmly grabbed anakins soul wanting let new servant glitter embittered eyes hatred everything thirst power breathe difficult imagine someone could better cope task therefore words left believe anakin battle obi wan skywalker remains memory forever battle people spent together whole lives battle brothers sacrificed lives others sake side skills determined obi wan brilliant way performance evan mcgregor follow easy ways achieve goals goes mustafar understands bitterness going therefore battle darkness battle feelings attachments unlike anakin obi wan firmly committed duty goals order reason sorry end person situation acted correctly easily time battle opposites yoda emperor battle goes concepts democracy peace freedom fate entire galaxy decided swords crossed good evil constantly side side weaving maintaining balance power crossing swords achieving different goals start padmé amidala without knowing center whole string culmination unfolds hours tragic figure unwittingly became key empire simply got rid unnecessarily natalie portman like fits gloomy sweep helpless panic reigns around heroine touching ardent unable change anything outside observer war collapse republic painful sad attention film given anakin whose fear sweeping increasingly turns ruler sith however persecution general grievous powerful battles amazing planets forget movie leave anyone indifferent yes whether restrain feelings legend remembered bravo george lucas highest ball,-0.05423605805958747,0.5786249045072572,0
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) - IMDb,"***Spoilers!****Lucas finally leaves behind the childish stupidity of the first two episodes and delivers a much grimmer movie. Too bad he does it so poorly. The first problem with the movie is the acting. The forced, pitiful dialogue is enough to make a person cringe. It is glaringly obvious during the exchanges between Padme and Anakin. But rather than leave a movie to be destroyed by bad dialogue and acting, Lucas decides to take it a step further and brilliantly adds a pointless robot villain named General Grievous. This robot's special power was that he had reptilian organs and suffered from a bad cough yet could somehow mysteriously breathe in space. But the hardest thing to stomach about this movie is Anakin's sudden and whimsical switch to the dark side. Lucas tries to create all of these different factors for Anakin's change to darkness, yet none are convincing enough. First Anakin struggles with visions of Padme's death, then he gets placed on the Jedi Council and is asked to spy on his dear friend Palpatine, and to top it all off, those stingy Jedi have the gall to not award Anakin with ""Master"" status. Then Palpatine reveals himself as the Sith Lord to Anakin and tells him they may be able to save Padme from death. One thing leads to another, and Anakin lops off Mace Windu's hand and decides to become a Sith. It is truly unbelievable. Out of 6 or so hours of movie-time between Episodes I, II, and III, 10 minutes are dedicated to the Dark side's ""seduction"" of Anakin Skywalker. It takes Palpatine 3 whole scenes to convince Anakin to switch sides. But the fun doesn't stop there, oh no! After walking the path of good(except that Sandperson incident in episode II) for all these years, Anakin has little problem slaughtering all of the Jedi younglings and hating all of the Jedi, especially Obi-Wan. The truly glorious thing is that this movie all takes place in maybe a week's time, and Anakin's complete switch to darkness takes about 1 minute. I suppose it is possible that the events in this movie were supposed to span a few months, but that is not made clear, due to the story-telling genius of Mr. Lucas. Lucas had two movies before this in which he could have shown a gradual change to darkness. That would have been believable. But Lucas is such an idiot and has no idea how to develop characters, and this is the result. Yes, it is understandable that Anakin is troubled and frustrated and supposedly loves his wife very much, but that just isn't enough to make his sudden change to the dark side believable. Lucas has had 28 years to figure out how Anakin became Darth Vader. You'd really think he could have come up with a more convincing story than this. But then something truly wonderful and realistic happens that nearly redeems the film. Padme simply ""loses the will to live"" and kicks the bucket. This is really great coming from a formerly strong and independent character, who now has children to concern herself with. But I guess that's not a good enough reason to live. It's a good thing that this trait isn't passed down to Luke, otherwise he may have dropped dead from depression in that Death Star trash compactor. I would also like to point out the stunning use of the drawn-out soap opera-esquire ""NOOOOOooooooo!!!"" that Darth Vader bellows forth upon discovering that Padme has perished.",deaconblues197919,May/2005,5, And Lucas' failure is complete.,0,"[finally, leaf, behind, childish, stupidity, first, two, episode, delivers, much, grimmer, movie, bad, poorly, first, problem, movie, act, force, pitiful, dialogue, enough, make, person, cringe, glaringly, obvious, exchange, padme, anakin, rather, leave, movie, destroyed, bad, dialogue, act, lucas, decides, take, step, brilliantly, add, pointless, robot, villain, name, general, grievous, robot, special, power, reptilian, organ, suffer, bad, cough, yet, could, somehow, mysteriously, breathe, space, hardest, thing, stomach, movie, anakin, sudden, whimsical, switch, dark, side, lucas, try, create, different, factor, anakin, change, darkness, yet, none, convincing, enough, first, anakin, struggle, vision, padme, death, get, place, jedi, council, ask, spy, dear, friend, palpatine, ...]","[spoilers!****lucas, finally leaves, behind, the childish stupidity, of, first, two episodes, delivers, a much grimmer movie, too bad he, does, it, so poorly, the first problem, with, the movie, is, the acting, forced, pitiful dialogue, is, enough, to, make, a person, cringe, it, is, glaringly obvious, during, the exchanges, between, padme and anakin, rather, leave, a movie, to, be destroyed, by, bad dialogue, acting, lucas, decides, to, take, it a step, further, brilliantly adds, a pointless robot villain, named, general grievous, this robot, special power, was, that, he, had, reptilian organs, suffered, from, a bad cough, yet could somehow mysteriously breathe, in, space, the hardest thing, to, stomach, about, this movie, is anakin, sudden and, whimsical switch, to, the dark side, lucas, tries, to, create, all of, these different factors, for, anakin, change, to, darkness, yet none, are, convincing, enough, first anakin struggles, with, visions, of, padme, death, then, he, gets placed, on, the jedi council, ...]",157.5205521157975,1.331063341531883,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,0,3,3,1,1,4,1,1,1,0,1,5,0,5.812785388127854,219,313,spoilers lucas finally leaves behind childish stupidity first episodes delivers much grimmer movie bad poorly first problem movie acting forced pitiful dialogue enough person cringe glaringly obvious exchanges padme anakin rather leave movie destroyed bad dialogue acting lucas decides take step brilliantly adds pointless robot villain named general grievous robots special power reptilian organs suffered bad cough yet could somehow mysteriously breathe space hardest thing stomach movie anakins sudden whimsical switch dark side lucas tries create different factors anakins change darkness yet none convincing enough first anakin struggles visions padmes death gets placed jedi council asked spy dear friend palpatine top stingy jedi gall award anakin master status palpatine reveals sith lord anakin tells may able save padme death thing leads another anakin lops mace windus hand decides become sith truly unbelievable 6 hours movie time episodes ii iii 10 minutes dedicated dark sides seduction anakin skywalker takes palpatine 3 whole scenes convince anakin switch sides fun stop oh walking path good except sandperson incident episode ii years anakin little problem slaughtering jedi younglings hating jedi especially obi wan truly glorious thing movie takes place maybe weeks time anakins complete switch darkness takes 1 minute suppose possible events movie supposed span months made clear due story telling genius lucas lucas movies could shown gradual change darkness would believable lucas idiot idea develop characters result yes understandable anakin troubled frustrated supposedly loves wife much enough sudden change dark side believable lucas 28 years figure anakin became darth vader would really think could convincing story something truly wonderful realistic happens nearly redeems film padme simply loses live kicks bucket really great coming formerly strong independent character children concern guess good enough reason live good thing trait passed luke otherwise may dropped dead depression death star trash compactor would like point stunning use drawn soap opera esquire noooooooooooo darth vader bellows forth upon discovering padme perished,0.03831895716224075,0.5529317697228144,1
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) - IMDb,"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is an excellent timeless classic that it is the best sequel of all time. I love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the Star Wars franchise that I love. The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels I can think of, it is right there with Aliens (1986), it is right there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish The Empire as a value treat. Empire Strikes Back is still and excellent film which I really believe is a timeless classic. This is my second favorite film from director Irvin Kershner. Number 1 favorite Irvin Kershner film will be RoboCop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. I still have to review those movies someday.Empire Strikes Back (1980) is the best one of the series, because it's deeper, darker, more philosophical. It's great because Darth Vader and the Empire are at their most menacing, the direction is creative, the characters feel real, the nature of the Force is explored more without losing its mysticism, and the pacing is, as George Lucas would put it, faster and more intense than any other film in the saga.The plot is actually more a rescue mission that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is coming to rescue his friends Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca are captured on a planet Bespin in Cloud City from villainous Darth Vader. Han Solo's friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) set the up and with Darth Vader he set a trap for Luke. Also Luke studied the Force under Jedi Master Yoda to become a full Jedi Knight but in the end he must confront Darth Vader (David Prowse) by him self. The origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled.Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980 it is directed by Irvin Kershner this time and not George Lucas. Because George Lucas decide that he want to make this sequel independent one, so he ended up coming with his own, founding for the film. Getting a loan and money he earn from the first movie and it success, so he decided he wanted, to found the film him self, and he wanted to be more an executive producer to keep an eye on the lamp, he moved to a bigger studio in Orange County, California, so he diced to be more a producer he did not want to direct Empire Strikes Back. So his first choice was Irvin Kershner, who was a professor at UC in the UC film school, that George attended too and he always liked Irvin Kershner and of course he was a former professor and it was a hard way talk him to do it and the first time Irvin Kershner didn't want to do it, so George called Irvin's agent and his agent said to Irvin take it so he did and the rest is a history. This stands the test of time, the best film he ever directed! I love John Williams score still the same, but I think John Williams changed the music score for a little bit, but that's just my opinion.Things that I love in this film: I love the battle with Rebels fighting with the Imperial AT-AT walkers on the ice world of Hoth. That is my favorite scene on ice world in the film. The Imperial AT-AT walkers are incredible well made with classic special effects.I love that the origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled, that Luke is the son of Darth Vader, who is actually Anakin Skywalker, before he become Darth Vader and went to the dark site.For the first time ever, we see an Emperor in a Hologram talking to Darth Vader.The Falcon with Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca hiding in the rocks try's to eat a monster.Luke faces with Darth Vader him self face to face and get his arm cut off and then he jumps off the bridge, because he didn't want to join his father in a dark force. The lightsaber duel throughout the chamber between Luke and Darth Vader was excellent and it was epic.The training sequence with Luke and master Yoda were excellent and epic. A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back are my favorite films in series, that are in the franchise, this film get's a perfect 10 score for been the best sci-fi adventure sequel of all time.",ivo-cobra825,April/2016,10," Excellent timeless classic, the best sequel of all time!",1,"[star, war, episode, v, empire, strike, back, excellent, timeless, classic, best, sequel, time, love, film, death, second, favorite, film, best, sequel, star, war, franchise, love, empire, strike, back, movie, one, best, sequel, think, right, alien, right, terminator, judgment, day, excellent, sequel, really, establish, empire, value, treat, empire, strike, back, still, excellent, film, really, believe, timeless, classic, second, favorite, film, director, irvin, kershner, number, favorite, irvin, kershner, film, robocop, underrated, action, flick, still, review, movie, strike, back, best, one, series, deeper, darker, philosophical, great, darth, vader, empire, menace, direction, creative, character, feel, real, nature, force, explore, without, lose, mysticism, pace, george, ...]","[star wars, episode, v, the empire strikes, back, is, an excellent timeless classic, that, it, is, the best sequel, of, all time, i, love, this film, to, death, it, is, my second favorite film, the best sequel, in, the star wars, franchise, that, i love, the empire strikes, back is, a movie, that, it, is, of, the best sequels, i can think, of, it, is right, there, with, aliens, it, is right, there, with, terminator, judgment day, it, is, an excellent sequel, it, really does establish, the empire, as, a value treat, empire strikes, back is, still and, excellent film, i really believe is, a timeless classic, is, my second favorite film, from, director irvin kershner, number 1 favorite irvin kershner film, will be, robocop, is very underrated, action flick, i, still have, to, review, movies, someday.empire strikes, back, is, best, of, the series, because, it, is, deeper, darker, more philosophical, it, is, great, because, darth vader and the empire, are, at, their, most menacing, the direction, is, creative, ...]",228.22823156003795,44.846328940547025,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,3,2,1,4,1,3,1,0,1,2,0,5.470588235294118,221,396,star wars episode v empire strikes 1980 excellent timeless classic best sequel time love film death second favorite film best sequel star wars franchise love empire strikes movie best sequels think right aliens 1986 right terminator 2 judgment day 1991 excellent sequel really establish empire value treat empire strikes still excellent film really believe timeless classic second favorite film director irvin kershner number 1 favorite irvin kershner film robocop 2 1990 underrated action flick still review movies someday empire strikes 1980 best series deeper darker philosophical great darth vader empire menacing direction creative characters feel real nature force explored without losing mysticism pacing george lucas would put faster intense film saga plot actually rescue mission luke skywalker mark hamill coming rescue friends han solo princess leia organa c 3po chewbacca captured planet bespin cloud city villainous darth vader han solos friend lando calrissian billy dee williams set darth vader set trap luke luke studied force jedi master yoda become full jedi knight end must confront darth vader david prowse self origins luke skywalker reveled empire strikes released 1980 directed irvin kershner time george lucas george lucas decide want sequel independent ended coming founding film getting loan money earn first movie success decided wanted found film self wanted executive producer keep eye lamp moved bigger studio orange county california diced producer want direct empire strikes first choice irvin kershner professor uc uc film school george attended always liked irvin kershner course former professor hard way talk first time irvin kershner want george called irvins agent agent said irvin take rest history stands test time best film ever directed love john williams score still think john williams changed music score little bit opinion things love film love battle rebels fighting imperial walkers ice world hoth favorite scene ice world film imperial walkers incredible well made classic special effects love origins luke skywalker reveled luke son darth vader actually anakin skywalker become darth vader went dark site first time ever emperor hologram talking darth vader falcon han solo princess leia organa c 3po chewbacca hiding rocks trys eat monster luke faces darth vader self face face arm cut jumps bridge want father dark force lightsaber duel throughout chamber luke darth vader excellent epic training sequence luke master yoda excellent epic new hope empire strikes favorite films series franchise film gets perfect 10 score best sci fi adventure sequel time,0.3759962032503017,0.5081541409410263,1
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) - IMDb,"Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi (1983) is a third sequel in the original Star Wars trilogy it is flawed, yet very entertaining solid third sequel and an epic conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy. Honestly in my opinion Return of the Jedi is far way better film than The Force Awakens, that movie was a disaster and it sucked, I rather watch this movie any time. It is not my favorite film in the series and I don't love this movie that much like I love the first two movies, but I like it and it think it is very good at some points. The film has a lot of problems, that hurts the movie. I still have enjoyed this movie and I had a lot of fun. Return of the Jedi (1983) is directed this time from Richard Marquand a different director than it was directed from Irvin Kershner and George Lucas. This movie was released on the same year that I was born in 1983. The film is pretty good on it is own way, but on the other thing it suffers from problems and flaws.Things I like in this movie: The first hour is set back on planet Tatooine which is a rescue mission which I like, the story is set where the first movie begins and ends here.Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO, and R2-D2 return to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo (who was encased in carbonite at the end of Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) from the gangster Jabba the Hutt (voice: Larry Ward).A battle on ship, with Luke steadily taking the fight to Jabba's men. During the battle, Leia strangles Jabba to death with the chain around her neck and with R2-D2's help escapes from her bonds. The heroes destroy the ship, kills the bad guys and save Han solo. I love the explosion, the rescue and than they are all save.I love that we find out from ghost of Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that Leia (Carrie Fisher) is the sister of Luke ( Mark Hamill). I love that Luke revels to Leia that she is his sister.I like the battle on the Endor, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2 and Ewoks are battling Stormtroopers to destroying the shield generator for the second Death Star and they do the destroy it. Lando and his assault team destroys the deaths tar on the end.Luke face Darth Vader and the evil Emperor and fights both of them, while they where both trying to bring him on a dark side of the force to join them.I love when Vader toys with the notion of turning Leia to the dark side, Luke gives in to his rage and furiously gains the upper hand in the battle, slicing off Vader's right robotic hand in a rage in one swift cut, and makes his father succumb to defeat at the mercy of his son's blade.Realizing that Luke cannot be turned, the Emperor uses Force lightning against him to torture and attempt to kill him. Deeply affected by the sight of his son dying before him, Vader repents and turns on the Emperor, throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death.Luke try's to save Anakin but he dies before he could save him.I feel that Luke's transition from a teenager to calm and collected warrior of the Force feels very authentic. His conflict between Darth Vader and the Emperor contains some of the best scenes in the entire saga.Things I don't like: The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate it: This movie's biggest flaw is the pacing, the Ewoks and their role in the film. Star Wars been in a forest, aren't Star Wars suppose to set in the Galaxy and not in the forest? Personally I don't mind the Ewoks, but their introduction causes the movie comes to a screeching halt. Another fault of this movie is its attempts at humor. It feels often unnatural and forced a lot of the time. The Phantom Menace has been notorious for having this problem as well, but they most likely originated here.Master Yoda dies in this film! Why? Watching Yoda in the prequels I have really enjoyed him much more than I have watching him in the last two movies. Little guy grove up in to my heart. So I disagree about him dying.I am giving this movie an 8, I watch A New Hope and Retun of the Jedi on TV as a kid I don't remember watching The Empire Strikes Back, but I have saw those tow movies and still I like Return of the Jedi a lot.",ivo-cobra828,April/2016,8," Flawed, very entertaining solid third sequel an epic conclusion to the original trilogy!",1,"[star, war, episode, vi, return, jedi, third, sequel, original, star, war, trilogy, flaw, yet, entertain, solid, third, sequel, epic, conclusion, original, star, war, trilogy, honestly, opinion, return, jedi, far, way, better, film, force, awakens, movie, disaster, suck, rather, watch, movie, time, favorite, film, series, love, movie, much, like, love, first, two, movie, like, think, good, point, film, lot, problem, hurt, movie, still, enjoy, movie, lot, fun, return, jedi, direct, time, richard, marquand, different, director, direct, irvin, kershner, george, lucas, movie, release, year, born, film, pretty, good, way, thing, suffers, problem, like, movie, first, hour, set, back, planet, tatooine, rescue, mission, ...]","[star wars, episode vi – return, of, the jedi, is, a third sequel, in, the original star wars, trilogy, it, is, flawed, yet very entertaining, solid third sequel, an epic conclusion, to, the original star wars, trilogy, honestly, in, my opinion return, of, the jedi, is, far way, better film, than, the force, awakens, that, movie, was, a disaster, it, sucked, i, rather watch, movie, any time, it, is, not, my, favorite film, in, the series, i, do, not, love, this movie, that, much, like, i, love, first, two movies, i, like, it and it, think, it, is, very good, at, some points, the film, has, a lot, of, problems, hurts, the movie, i, still have enjoyed, this movie, i, had, a lot, of, fun, return, of, the jedi, is directed, this time, from, richard, marquand, a different director, than, it, was directed, from, irvin kershner and george lucas, this movie, was released, on, the same year, ...]",254.6717505931496,29.822875790423407,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,1,2,1,4,2,3,1,0,1,2,0,5.423387096774193,248,410,star wars episode vi – return jedi 1983 third sequel original star wars trilogy flawed yet entertaining solid third sequel epic conclusion original star wars trilogy honestly opinion return jedi far way better film force awakens movie disaster sucked rather watch movie time favorite film series love movie much like love first movies like think good points film lot problems hurts movie still enjoyed movie lot fun return jedi 1983 directed time richard marquand different director directed irvin kershner george lucas movie released year born 1983 film pretty good way thing suffers problems flaws things like movie first hour set planet tatooine rescue mission like story set first movie begins ends jedi knight luke skywalker chewbacca lando calrissian princess leia organa c 3po r2 d2 return tatooine rescue han solo encased carbonite end star wars episode v empire strikes gangster jabba hutt voice larry ward battle ship luke steadily taking fight jabbas men battle leia strangles jabba death chain around neck r2 d2s help escapes bonds heroes destroy ship kills bad guys save han solo love explosion rescue save love ghost obi wan ben kenobi alec guinness leia carrie fisher sister luke mark hamill love luke revels leia sister like battle endor leia han chewbacca c 3po r2 d2 ewoks battling stormtroopers destroying shield generator second death star destroy lando assault team destroys deaths tar end luke face darth vader evil emperor fights trying bring dark side force love vader toys notion turning leia dark side luke gives rage furiously gains upper hand battle slicing vaders right robotic hand rage swift cut makes father succumb defeat mercy sons blade realizing luke turned emperor uses force lightning torture attempt kill deeply affected sight son dying vader repents turns emperor throwing reactor shaft death luke trys save anakin dies could save feel lukes transition teenager calm collected warrior force feels authentic conflict darth vader emperor contains best scenes entire saga things like film problems really unnecessary really hate movies biggest flaw pacing ewoks role film star wars forest star wars suppose set galaxy forest personally mind ewoks introduction causes movie comes screeching halt another fault movie attempts humor feels often unnatural forced lot time phantom menace notorious problem well likely originated master yoda dies film watching yoda prequels really enjoyed much watching last movies little guy grove heart disagree dying giving movie 8 watch new hope retun jedi tv kid remember watching empire strikes saw tow movies still like return jedi lot,0.12019727348674716,0.48594022936128173,1
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) - IMDb,This movie is a bit disappointment after good New Hope and Empire strikes back. This movie has at the same time one of the best moments in Star Wars(emperor Palpatine) and worst(Ewoks). I personally didn't like Jabba the Hutt. It somehow made this movie look a bit comedy. But that wasn't the main reason. Ewoks made this movie bad.As for final battle that was disappointing too. The ground battle was terrible. Ewoks against stormtroopers. Ewoks didn't have any credibility but still Stormtroopers made to look like incompetent clowns..Ground battle was nothing like in the Empire strikes back.As for space battle. That was disappointing too. We didn't get too see what Star destroyer could do in the battle. Actually they didn't too anything. Even the Super Star destroyer was destroyed too fast and too easily.

Stealth (2005) - IMDb,"Stealth is the best movie of the summer. And when I say best, what I mean is that it's the most hackneyed and predictable 130-million dollar piece of crap action flick of the year. Stealth has no intentional redeeming qualities whatsoever, and plays into every single textbook stereotype of the genre. Thus, if you're the kind of person who loves Mystery Science Theatre 3000, you must, must go see Stealth immediately.Stealth follows the exploits of three Navy pilots in a top secret program involving, well, experimental stealth fighters. There's Lt. Ben Gannon (Josh Lucas): the white-bread pretty-boy with a smarmy attitude with a history of breaking rules and taking too many risks, played like a twisted caricature of 'Maverick' Mitchell of Top Gun. There's Kara Wade (Jessica Biel): the obligatory Caucasian hottie pilot who spouts clichéd feminist rhetoric and sports an ""I can do anything you can do, better"" attitude aligned more with the Spice Girls than Andrea Dworkin; the pink teddy lingerie and frilly bra she apparently wears under her LuLu Lemon flight suit don't help her cause either. Finally, there's Henry Purcell (Jamie Foxx) the black male who listens to rap music, has indiscriminate sex with as many women as possible, and poses for imaginary photographers in his bedroom. For no apparent reason he's also a mathematician and numerology nut who later expounds that ""one is a prime number"".The fourth character is ""Tin Man"", the artificially intelligent experimental stealth fighter assigned to the squadron. Its brain uses ""quantum computation"" and processes ""20 terabits per second"" which is pretty impressive until you realize the number doesn't make any sense. Having a computer as sympathetic character is a pretty cool idea. At least it was in 1968 when Kubrick made 2001: A Space Odyssey, though Tin Man's inflective voice and bizarre penchant for rock music suggests a closer relation to Max-- the shipboard computer in Disney's Flight of the Navigator-- than HAL 9000. This doesn't stop the writers from making bizarre homages to Kubrick's space opus; in fact one major plot point centers on the computer overhearing a conversation in a scene shot much like HAL's famous lip-reading in the Pod. The computer also has a big red eye, which is dumb because it doesn't need to see anything with it, but cool because it helps the computer emote more effectively.After a minor sortie in Rangoon (where ""three terrorist leaders"" are meeting in ""a building still under construction"" (which is important because now they can implode the building without killing any civilians-- go America!)), and then an extended Thailand vacation sequence where the pilots engage in tedious ham-fisted metaphysical discussions about whether Tin Man is actually alive, the computer predictably goes nuts and decides to attack a fortified terrorist camp in Tzadzikistan or something that just got access to some old Russian nuclear warheads and SCUD launchers. (We know they're terrorists because of the turbans and the fact that they're moving the warheads around on carts pulled by mules.) The nukes get blown up but radioactive dust falls down the mountain side and kills ""thousands of innocent farmers"" which I guess is bad but they don't spend too long worrying about it because they have to catch the psycho stealth.Usual stuff happens after that-- a pilot hits the side of a mountain, another one goes down inexplicably in North Korea, and the remaining one has to avenge his friend's death and rescue the other pilot from the Koreans' evil clutches. The ability of these planes to be in Rangoon, Tzadzikistan, Russia, Alaska, and Korea on just a few tanks of gas is explained by their ability to hit hypersonic speeds exceeding Mach 5 which is cool because it's like warp speed on Star Trek-- they punch a button and the planes zip away in a bullet cone of displaced air and end up in a new locale more suitable for extreme aerobatics. They also get to fly against the Russians which is funny because the Russians obviously haven't built any new planes since the fall of the Soviet Union, which begs the question: why do the stealths have such trouble with them? Why don't they just hit the Mach 5 button and get out of there? Is there something about the shocking yellow and brown paint job on the anachronistic Migs that impedes the functioning of hypersonic engines? The plot isn't really important-- what is important is that the movie contains a wealth of brain-dead inaccuracies for geeks to make fun of. From bizarre phrases like ""the Stealth has firewall-ed the transponder!"" to the fact that the Stealth's brain is made alternately from quantum hardware, neural networks, and DNA sequences depending on which one looks coolest for the effects sequence, and was apparently programmed by hand by one man using a futuristic language reminiscent of Matlab, to the way that the naval command is powered by transparent lexan PC cases decked out with coloured LCD cooling fans, this movie just stinks of technical naivety due to lack of research as opposed to creative liberty.Stealth is a movie that begs its own drinking game. It should be watched with a group of people in an environment that engenders snarky comments. Stealth is not a good movie in any way, shape, or form, but it is a film that is so stupefyingly bad it absolutely must be seen to be believed.",mike-verdone9,August/2005,3, Stupefying and hilariously

"Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928) - IMDb","Buster Keaton was a lunatic. He had to have been. The stunts he was able to pull off in this movie leave me questioning his sanity. This film has moments where you won't believe his stunts weren't done via some nifty camera forgery. It's just amazing that his stunts were accomplished while one camera(yes, just one) was aimed at a spot that was marked for Buster to hit. This precision had to be met or death and disaster could follow. This was most apparent in the cyclone scene with the wall of a house that fell to the ground. Any deviation by an inch from the mark and a house could fall on top of Buster's head. I had to watch that scene over and over again. This film is filled with great gymnastics from Buster, as he did hit all of his marks. Although this movie has some of Buster's best comedic gymnastics, there are a couple of memorable scenes of pantomime. There's the scene near the beginning of the film when Buster is trying on an array of hats for his father. Buster looks right into the camera as if looking into a mirror, just a great effect. And later there's another scene where Buster tries to break his father out of jail by pantomiming the instructions of escape by using only his hands and a loaf of bread. By the end of the film you'll be marveling at Buster's dexterity while he operates the steamboat by climbing up and over or jumping down and around the ship, running the ship by himself and with the help of a few helpfully placed ropes.

Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot (1992) - IMDb,"I have little to say about this movie other than it is nowhere near as bad as I'd been led to believe. Actually quite amusing in places, it will strike a chord with anyone who has an interfering mother (and God knows I have!) as Estelle Getty invades Stallone's life.I fail to see the reason for all the bad spirit directed at this film. The incidental music is a little repetitive and it's admittedly a one-joke plot. But it is a fairly good joke, and would have made for a superb hour-length TV movie. Unfortunately it's a 90 minute cinema film and so doesn't maintain its momentum all the way through.I've seen people criticise the film for Stallone not getting to be ""funny"" in this movie. I mean, have you heard of a straight man?? Sylvester's contribution to the comedy is his underplayed reaction to his mother's obsessive behaviour. What do you expect him to do, dress up and tell jokes?Admittedly, the surprisingly violent aspects of the film don't sit well, and it's hard to laugh at Getty when she's just shot a man and splattered his blood all over an airplane runway. Another problem is that her chemistry with Stallone isn't as pin-sharp as it could be; the two leave notable pauses in between lines. Maybe a few more takes could have honed up the reaction time, but generally it's fine, and Stallone really makes an effort to make it work.Not an all-time classic, certainly, but a pleasant enough film to pass a Sunday afternoon.

Supergirl (1984) - IMDb,"Watching Supergirl this week for the first time since childhood I see it with fresh eyes and a newfound appreciation of the movie. Supergirl must be considered separate and unrelated to the Superman movie foursome or it will fall short. There is not supposed to be a comparison. The Superman movies are action epics, Supergirl is the story of strength growing out of innocence.Watching Supergirl now with an understanding of focus that I did not have when younger, I truly enjoy it. Helen Slater, Peter O'Tool, Peter Cook and Maureen Teefy all put in superb performances. Mia Farrow tends to overact the part of Selena, but then the character believes herself larger than life. Brenda Vaccaro could use a little more self assertion, but does alright. Marc McClure is of course an undeniably talented actor, though his part in this film is minor. I am forced to scream at the screen however; Why the hell do you wear a camera if you aren't going to use it when a major news piece flies into your lap?I remember being dismissive of Supergirl when I was younger; due in part to the use of magic which has no part in the Superman films, but mainly I suspect due to the ludicrous man-eating excavator scene. This scene remains the major absurdity of the movie. Supposed to be terrifying it comes off as a rather poor imitation of the hundred Volkswagens from Herbie Rides Again. It isn't scary, its stupid.Apart from that scene, Supergirl is good gentle viewing and a nice counterpoint to Superman.It is hard to describe my exact feelings, but I do feel that standing on its own Supergirl should be considered a success and I deeply regret never having a chance to watch the sequels that were never made.",dwtaxi14,December/2006,7, A gentle tale worth watching with a relaxed mind.,1,"[watch, supergirl, week, first, time, since, childhood, see, fresh, eye, newfound, appreciation, movie, supergirl, must, consider, separate, unrelated, superman, movie, foursome, fall, short, suppose, comparison, superman, movie, action, epic, supergirl, story, strength, grow, supergirl, understand, focus, young, truly, enjoy, helen, slater, peter, peter, cook, maureen, teefy, put, superb, performance, mia, farrow, tends, overact, part, selena, character, belief, large, life, brenda, vaccaro, could, use, little, self, assertion, alright, marc, mcclure, course, undeniably, talented, actor, though, part, film, minor, force, scream, screen, however, hell, wear, camera, go, use, major, news, piece, fly, lap, remember, dismissive, supergirl, young, due, part, use, magic, part, ...]","[watching supergirl, this week, for, the first time, since, childhood i see it, with, fresh eyes, a newfound appreciation, of, the movie, supergirl, must be considered, separate and unrelated, to, the superman movie foursome, it, will fall, short, is not supposed, to, be, a comparison, the superman movies, are, action, epics, supergirl, is, the story, of, strength, growing, out of, innocence.watching supergirl, now, with, an understanding, of, focus, that, i, did not have, when, younger, i, truly enjoy, it, helen, slater, peter, o'tool, peter, cook, maureen teefy, put, in, superb performances, mia farrow, tends, to, overact, the part, of, selena, then, the character, believes, herself, larger, than, life, brenda vaccaro, could use, a little more self assertion, does, alright, marc mcclure is, of, course, an undeniably talented actor, though, his part, in, this film, is, minor, i, am forced, to, scream, at, the screen, however, why, the hell, do, you, wear, a camera, ...]",-25.64239719295443,-6.689289226791394,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,4,0,2,0,2,0,2,5.920634920634921,126,155,watching supergirl week first time since childhood fresh eyes newfound appreciation movie supergirl must considered separate unrelated superman movie foursome fall short supposed comparison superman movies action epics supergirl story strength growing innocence watching supergirl understanding focus younger truly enjoy helen slater peter otool peter cook maureen teefy put superb performances mia farrow tends overact part selena character believes larger life brenda vaccaro could use little self assertion alright marc mcclure course undeniably talented actor though part film minor forced scream screen however hell wear camera going use major news piece flies lap remember dismissive supergirl younger due part use magic part superman films mainly suspect due ludicrous man eating excavator scene scene remains major absurdity movie supposed terrifying comes rather poor imitation hundred volkswagens herbie rides scary stupid apart scene supergirl good gentle viewing nice counterpoint superman hard describe exact feelings feel standing supergirl considered success deeply regret never chance watch sequels never made,0.05416666666666668,0.4938172043010753,1
Supergirl (1984) - IMDb,"I could make this very long, or I could make it strict. stricted? yes... This is a truely wonderfull movie that on a mainstreame level has never gotten the attention it deserves. Faye Dunaway is a excellant adversory to Helen Slater and almost everyone in this movie seems to have a great chemistry together wich is outputed highley during it. The special FX are wonderfull and were advanced for its time, many in the movie even to today's standards. It has its roots in artistic litrature, it has heart, because the movie is about a teenager there is a vulrability to it wich feels more humane and personal to a level of a teenager myself...unlike the Superman movies where you simply feel ""yes, he's super...he can do anything. good for him"" This movie suffered for many reasons wich isn't about its story. It was marketed purley as a Superman ""action sueprhero"" sort of movie. When the fact is there is a more gentile apraoch to this film, sourcery, love and lots of imaginative things wich make it very unique to the superhero genre. unfortunatley it doesn't do it much favours considering to many it is the worst superhero movie ever. Everything about this movie is very imaginative and creative. From Supergirl flying out of a lake without getting wet to her almost flawless flying ballet (THATS when u believe a person can fly. Unlike Supermans blue screen FX) and the highly inspireing fair ground scenes. This is purley fantasy. Not a Spiderman/Superman action superhero movie wich it was promoted to be. So its real targeted audience didn't want to see it as its trailer and promotion didn't look like ""their sorta thing"" and the people that did see it were dissapointed as it wasn't what it was said to be. so let me say...STUPID marketting team!simply...its like making American Pie SOUND LIKE the matrix. Many people saw Supergirl and did not expect to see many of the things they saw.
If this film was marketed the way it should have been and released the way it should have been (some countries got a seriously bad edited version wich effected the charactors allot) then this would have been the success everyone thought at the time and still deserves to be This is a great movie and its one of my favourites. I don't think I could praise it enough. I think its not what many people wanted ot see back then though...they wanted explosions, action and they wanted Superman to fit into this film.I think the fact that Supergirl arrived on earth in the supercostume without no actual logic was bad. Because firstly you need rules, and even more so in fantasy movies. Because it may be fantasy but you still should believe it. I think it could have easily been written in for Supergirl to get her costume. Zaltar could have made her it because she is a big admirer of her cousin Superman. But no, unfortunatley it isn't once explained how and were she got her costume from. Also...the instant costume portrays that she is an instant hero and she wasn't wich let many people down. As she was still nieve, cute and girly and not the strong wilded heroine she turned out to be at the end.Also, this movie arguable did not fit into the superman mythology very well...But so be it. There is no flaw in this movie that could effect the enjoyment and believability of the movie. On its DVD release there are more visual flaws then I saw on its video release wich is surprising. Not many however but on her first ever flying shot there are...wich makes me cringe. HOWEVER, I am still to see better better flying in a movie that isn't from Supergirl. Highlights of this movie deffanitly are Supergirls flying ballet (you will never see anything as visually wonderfull and pretty as this in a film) and Supergirls scenes with Ethan. This movie is full of heart and art, with beautifull actors and its all acompanied by a wonderfull score wich captures allot of emotion and depth.I will end this review with that you WILL believe a girl can fly.

One of the key things about the best spoof movies, like Airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny, the cast for the most part play is completely straight. This makes it even funnier. Even when there is simple dialog in the foreground, there may well be funny things happening behind the cast. Again funny. The other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts, to hang the gags on.The recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies, THEN try and spoof them. As a result the so-called plot of these movies very rarely exist. Another flaw these movies have, is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions, and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene! The cast try to get into the spirit required, but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes, it's hard to get worked up about it.As recent spoof movies go, it's not as bad as Epic Movie, Date Movie, or the awful Meet The Spartans, but considering that some people involved here have made good, funny movies in the past, it's nowhere near good enough.",kevin_crighton20,June/2008,3," Better than most recent spoofs, but still not good",0,"[loser, teen, bitten, insect, becomes, superhero, dragonfly, superhero, movie, late, spoof, movie, hit, screen, sadly, however, despite, presence, david, zucker, involve, airplane, top, secret, naked, gun, movie, still, suffers, fault, recent, spoof, mainly, dumb, fun, fault, mainly, lie, gag, simply, funny, enough, joke, work, nail, gun, scene, part, simply, fall, flat, spoof, example, whole, fart, sequence, blazing, saddle, one, key, thing, best, spoof, movie, like, airplane, although, dialog, extremely, funny, cast, part, play, completely, straight, make, even, funnier, even, simple, dialog, foreground, may, well, funny, thing, happen, behind, cast, funny, key, thing, plot, sort, hang, gag, recent, trend, seems, take, ...]","[when, a loser teen, is bitten, by, an insect, he, becomes, the superhero, dragonfly...superhero movie, is, the latest spoof movie, to, hit, the screens, sadly however, despite, the presence, of, david zucker, was involved, with, airplane, top secret, the naked gun movies, it, still suffers, from, the fault, most recent spoofs, have...mainly, it, is, more dumb, than, fun, the fault, mainly lies, with, the gags, it, is, simply not funny, enough, some of, the jokes, do work, such, as, the nail gun scene, other parts, simply fall, flat, the x-men spoof, for, example, the whole farting sequence, blazing saddles, is, not, of, the key things, about, the best spoof movies, like, airplane, is, that although, the dialog, is, extremely funny, the cast, for, the most part play, is, completely straight, makes, it, even funnier, even when, is, simple dialog, in, the foreground, may well be, funny things, happening, behind, the cast, again funny, the other key thing, is, that, they all have, a plot, of, sorts, to, hang, the gags, on.the recent trend, ...]",-36.2377744060438,11.473554086239805,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,3,2,0,0,4,4,0,2,0,2,4,2,5.352380952380952,105,156,loser teen bitten insect becomes superhero dragonfly superhero movie latest spoof movie hit screens sadly however despite presence david zucker involved airplane top secret naked gun movies still suffers fault recent spoofs mainly dumb fun fault mainly lies gags simply funny enough jokes work nail gun scene parts simply fall flat x men spoof example whole farting sequence blazing saddles key things best spoof movies like airplane although dialog extremely funny cast part play completely straight makes even funnier even simple dialog foreground may well funny things happening behind cast funny key thing plot sorts hang gags recent trend seems take scenes various movies spoof result called plot movies rarely exist another flaw movies scenes actually funny original versions cases even funnier spoof scene cast spirit required lot unfunny dialog scenes hard worked recent spoof movies bad epic movie date movie awful meet spartans considering people involved made good funny movies past nowhere near good enough,0.031914893617021274,0.5410840932117528,1
Superman III (1983) - IMDb,"Superman III (1983) is very extremely underrated bashed hated film and I am going to defend this film today! It is one of my personal favorite Superman movies of all time. Yes you read the title I love Superman III it is my childhood movie, I grew up watching this film and it was the first film I saw as a kid. Since I saw half of the second film Richard Lester version. Christopher Reeve will always be Clark Kent Superman for me no one else can replace him I don't care what anyone says. I kept wining to my parents that I want to see Superman movie and in the video store a lady video store owner gave me Superman III on VHS when I was a kid and it was the only movie she had. Superman III is MILES way better than crappy lame Zack Snyder's Man of Steel and Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice I hate those movies. I find this film enjoyable, well-done, and extremely underrated. The effects & technology are extremely dated (especially the computers), but this is still a decent, well-done film. Plot: Synthetic kryptonite laced with tobacco tar splits Superman in two: good Clark Kent and bad Man of Steel. Thing's I love in this movie, why I gave the most highest rating in this film and why I am defending it:Christopher Reeve is and always will be the only SUPERMAN! No one could play Clark Kent/Superman like Christopher Reeve, If anyone could be Superman, It is Christopher Reeve! The opening sequence with the ""fools of Metropolis"" was amusing, in a slap-stick way; this intentionally reminded me of some of the old slap-stick routines from years before (Laurel & Hardy; Three Stooges; etc.). And, sure, a lot of Superman III was comedic, but a lot of this was just in line with the Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor) character. Superman/Clark going back to Smallville for his high school reunion & running into Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole), etc. Very cool sequence, and I liked seeing Superman return to his ""roots"". Also, based on the reunion you get an idea of the character's ages - i.e., the reunion said ""Class of 1965"" & since the film came out in 1983 (and supposedly was set in ""real time), then Clark & his class-mates were all around 36 years old at that point.This film focus more on Lana Lang, Clark's first love, Lois was Clark's eternal Love but Lana was his first love. Annette O'Toole was perfectly as Lana Lang after long 18 years Annette was cast as Martha Kent in Smallville. In Superman: The Movie Lana Lang was played by actress Diane Sherry and she only had a cameo scene and than she disappeared from the rest of the film. Here we find out more about Clark and Lana's love! I saw Clark and Lois in the first two films but now we see more Clark and Lana's love story. Superman save's Ricky (Paul Kaethler) Lana's son in the corn filed from the tractor that scene was really serious, the kid could have been seriously crushed, it that could have happened in real life. This film was filmed and released in year of 1983 the year that I was born. This was my first Superman movie and it is my childhood film, I love it to death and I will always cherished. The whole sequence where Superman was exposed to the ""Red Kryptonite"" (though they didn't call it that in the episode) and became dark/somewhat evil. They did a great job of transforming Superman/Clark to look dirty/unshaven/burned out (even his costume was darker!), and not only disinterested in helping others - but also being somewhat malicious as well. I especially liked the battle that Superman had with his good & bad selves in the junkyard; I'm guessing this battle may have been metaphorical. It was also interesting on another level, because we saw what would happen if Superman had been evil instead of good. That scene was also used in Smallville Season 2 Episode 4: Red Clark was exposed to Red kryptonite and he evil. Richard Pryor as the scam artist Gus Gorman was good and hilarious the same time - obviously, because of his inclusion many fans probably dismissed the film as a comedy; however, his presence brought a light-heartiness to the film that was reminiscent of the comedic Ned Beatty character from Superman I & II. Christopher Reeve was perfect as Clark Kent/Superman he acted brilliant his character, he is the only Superman and superhero for me.This is Richard Lester original version film and he didn't had to re shot scenes from Richard Donner. The rest of the actors did a solid job and I really didn't had any problems with them. Robert Vaughn was a great villain I am glad the franchise had a new villain in all films Lex Luthor was five time the villain in all Superman franchise movies.Ross Webster was a great villain and the scene where Vera (Annie Ross) becomes a robot and she becomes evil really scares me. Brad Wilson played by Gavan O'Herlihy: Lana's former boyfriend, the character from the first film also returns in the first film he was played by Brad Flock.Superman III is a 1983 British superhero film directed by Richard Lester, based on the DC Comics character Superman. It is the third film in the Superman film series and the last Superman film to be produced by Alexander Salkind and Ilya Salkind.

Superman III (1983) - IMDb,"My Take: It never reaches the heights of its predecessors with its sillier story and ridiculous villains. Many consider this a weak entry in the Superman film series. Well, I thought it was at first. But when I watched it in numerous reruns, I began to like this. Christopher Reeve excellently reprises his role, alongside comedy favorite Richard Pryor, as a computer-whiz, who is hired by his boss to help fulfill his plans for world domination. Pryor may not do it right sometimes, but he's admittedly hilarious in spots. But painfully ridiculous in some. Among the things that make it a bit unsatisfying for critics is the lack of the characters from the originals. Lois lane had to go on vacation, so Lana Lang (played well by Annette O'Toole)is Superman's/Clark Kent's love interest. Robert Vaughn plays a sinister mastermind, an okay replacement for the famous villain Lex Luther. What some viewers don't understand is that director Richard Lester wants it to be more of a comic book adventure rather than what scriptwriter Mario Puzo did in the first two.

Sword of the Stranger (2007) - IMDb,"My perception of 2D animation practically changed after seeing this movie. No doubt about it. Since today's standards mostly rely on 3D technology to capture realistic and fluid movements in animation, this movie shatters the limits I thought really existed in 2D animation. Since animation marvels like Samurai Champloo back in 2005, Chinese and Japanese sword arts never looked so good in an anime. However yes 3D technology was used in making this movie but only to a limited extent to which it only deemed necessary like cameras panning to arrows, panning fluidly on background terrain and such. All the organic character movements were hand drawn so perfectly well that even all the action was so clear which is just a marvel to see over and over again. The story may not be the most original but at the same time it isn't bad at all. In fact the characters of this movie retain their depth throughout the entire film which makes it easy for any viewer especially who appreciates animation to look past it as the movie alone offers plenty of intriguing visuals that sincerely complement the story backed by a superb soundtrack which captures the very essences and themes of the setting.

Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) - IMDb,"Before you watch this film, just be aware that you're not going to walk away from it with a big smile on your face. More like you'll want to slit your wrists. To say that Mr. Vengeance is a powerful, gut-wrenching nightmare is like saying that DaVinci merely dabbled in art.The plot is so simple yet so complex. The direction is so elegant yet so hard-hitting. The simplistic nature of the story makes the descent into hell so shocking and captivating. You don't realize there is no going back until it's far, FAR too late.Ryu is a deaf/mute who works in the loudest factory in the world, doing a really depressing job. His sister needs a kidney transplant, but they don't have the money to pay for it. He cannot give her one of his own because their blood types do not match. Ryu decides to go to black market organ traders to trade one of his own for one that matches his sister. Waking up naked and kidney-less in an abandoned building he now needs to raise money for his own kidney.Ryu is now fired from his job by President Park, who is downsizing the company. His anarchist girlfriend Yeong-mi convinces him to kidnap Park's daughter and hold her to ransom. From then on, things get very, very, VERY heavy and the idea of who exactly Mr. Vengeance is is blurred and sympathy is felt for almost everyone. Revenge comes at a high price and seemingly never ends. Not that I am saying forgiving and forgetting is the way. But this movie will make you think twice about getting your own back.The violence is spontaneous and extremely graphic without ever feeling exploitational. Sometimes it has a darkly comic feel to it, the rest of the time it's goddamn hardcore. You'll wince a great deal during this movie, that's for damn sure.Park Chan-wook directs with such beautifully composed images that are far from the the garish MTV-style action/thriller movies produced in Hollywood these days. I don't want to sound like some sort of snob who proclaims all foreign films to be great and all Hollywood to be crap but it's not very often that Hollywood makes a film like this unless it's a remake. Written in a mere 20 hours in a single massive, creative outburst, this movie seems to have genius laced through every minute of it's running time.Not a date movie, not a whogivesadamn pig-out movie.

Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War (2004) - IMDb,"This 2.5 hour long movie was wonderful! As a Korean, this movie was very emotionally moving and touching. Some people (mainly Westerners) think this movie was ""over-dramatic"", but it's actually a part of korean custom, culture and history.

Taken (2008) - IMDb,"Wow - I had already read reviews of this movie, and with the writer being one of my favourite directors, Luc Besson, I just had to go see this movie as soon as possible...I was not disappointed... I'm not sure if this was intentional but there were no trailers before the movie, so being thrown strait into the film unexpectedly with people whispering ""is this it then ?"" only helping build up some initial tension and excitement.The film starts nicely, but with overtones of spy thrillers like ""Day of the Jackal"" coming to mind. Neeson seems a bit pityful at the start, but soon overturns that impression with a taste of his handywork after around ten minutes of the thriller.Then, before you know it, it's over. 93 minutes, gone in a blur of fighting, fear, chasing and excitement at serious pace. The artwork and direction is nicely done, giving you the feeling of being the one attacking and the chair squirming feeling of being the poor gits who get annihilated in almost every way possible.It was one of those films that I wanted to applause after the film, I actually clapped about three times, but no-one joined in... too afraid of being the only two people clapping I suppose...Neeson was great, and I can't wait to see the movie many more times. I only gave it 9 out of 10, as it was too short ! The film could have been easily stretched to 2 hours in my opinion, with some more development and intimacy with the characters.

Taken (2008) - IMDb,"I've never written a review before, but this movie angered me so much I felt it's my civic duty to protest.The movie is so full of clichés and unrealistic it's unbelievable it was made by adults. Apparently, we're supposed to derive some kind of psychological gratification from the Freudian symbols of innocence, fatherly love, superhuman strength and righteousness. It actually reminds me of the fantasies I had when I was 8.Here's the plot: a rich, spoiled American virgin girl goes to Paris with a friend and gets abducted by Albanians and sold into sex slavery. Luckily, her daddy happens to be a ex-CIA agent and tracks them down effortlessly, kills and tortures them in a blood-curdling fashion and gets to his daughter just before she gets her throat slit by the evil (yet also stupid looking so you can still feel good about yourself), toad-like sheik. On his way, daddy makes a such a spectacle of killing and torturing people that it makes you wonder whether anyone would take so much trouble if no third party was watching. He doesn't even spare people who are innocent and are unlucky enough to get in his way. Like the wife of a French agent involved in the mess, whom Neeson shoots in the arm, because her husband refuses to give him information on St-Claire. (Meanwhile, their kids have been tucked into bed 5 minutes ago yet they don't seem to wake up. Yep, totally.)All the circumstances are miraculously in Neeson's favor. His daughter is talking to him on the phone when she gets abducted. (otherwise, how would he know? Most victims of sex slavery are poor East European girls who don't have cell-phones, which would be too boring). Also, she's standing in the bathroom from where she can see her friend being abducted first, so daddy has enough time to instruct her how to hide and to shout out the details of their complexion while being dragged away (at which she miraculously succeeds, despite her panic and the struggle she puts up).Also, multiple men can apparently easily get into a hotel room and abduct two girls, but Neeson has to use Spiderman skills to get inside. Well, thank God the bas relief of the wall was adjusted to his height exactly; otherwise, the movie would have ended there.Another point that disturbed me very much is Neeson indifference to the scores of other girls who have been drugged and raped by Albanians. Apparently, the PRINCIPLE of sex slavery doesn't concern him, just the fact that it happens to HIS daughter.In the end, Neeson returns with his daughter to America, with only a broken arm after fighting hundreds of heavily-armed men. Also, he has no trouble leaving France after killing each and every one of them. (France must be a Third World country). Everyone is happy and his ex-wife has to admit he's not such a loser after all. Every Freudian fascination has been satisfied trice over.This movie does absolutely no justice to Eastern Europeans (all Albanians are shown as stupid scum and we're supposed to gloat seeing them being electrocuted), and above all, the REAL victims of modern sex slavery. I could write a lot more about this piece of garbage but I think I've made my point now.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993) - IMDb,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III in my opinion it is a underrated solid good sequel to the original flick. Everyone hates this film and going for the second film. This one get's the crap for it and the second one gets the praised. This film was actually the first film in the trilogy that I have watched. As child I wanted so badly to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the original movie it was my biggest childhood wish, I heard that Splinter throw Shredder off the roof, I didn't know in which movie that was, so my mom bought me Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III on VHS in 1993, when this movie come out. The VHS sadly had a terrible picture quality and awful sound but even with all that I still liked the film not seeing the first two films. But after watching the first two films, they both become my favorite films, but I hated this one because there was no Shredder, Rocksteady, Bebop, Foot clan or Krang in this movie, that was than. I was really surprised by this film. They don't use jokes in here, they try too, but they aren't cartoonish like are in the second one. They actually use weapons and swords, nunchakus, not their fists they are Ninja Turtles so they are using weapons which I love that. The only thing that hurt the film are the costumes they aren't Jim Henson's Creature Shop, they are more cheap costumes that were provided by Effects Company the animatronics, that is a minor flaw. Plot: The four turtles travel back in time to the days of the legendary and deadly samurai in ancient Japan, where they train to perfect the art of becoming one. The turtles also assist a small village in an uprising.It is my childhood film. I love that the story is original, no one brings back the characters who died back again. Elias Koteas reprise his role back as Casey Jones and he also plays another character Whit a double spy by Walker's army. There is less humor in this film and it is more serious. Turtles are using there weapons. Leonardo is a bad ass. Fighting Japanese Samurai was awesome. I love that Turtles are back in the time in ancient old Japan, where the air was more cleaner, than it is today. I love Stuart Wilson as the villain Walker. A year later he was another villain in Lethal Weapon 3. Seriously I don't see the hate for this film I love it a lot! I love that Elias Koteas plays two double roles, one as Casey Jones and the second one as Whit. Again a lot of people are complaining because Casey Jones doesn't do anything in the film, just sit around, really? Seriously? Haven't you watched the movie? Whit (Elias Koteas) kills Waalker on the end of the film, when he fires a fire ball on Walker, while he try's to escape. Leonardo defeats Lord Norinaga (Sab Shimono) in a sword fight, even tough the scene was hilarious I still have enjoy it. I love the music score and song Tarzan Boy by Baltimora and of course Rockin' Over The Beat by Technotronic. Paige Turco did outstanding performance as April O'Neil much better than she did in The secret of the Ooze. I grew up with this movie as a child a lot, I have even had Michelangelo and Walker's toy's, I Think I even had a Raphael figure I am not sure. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III is a 1993 American action comedy film based on the comic book characters the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. It is the second sequel to the 1990 live-action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film. Overall: I love this movie it get's 6 by me, I love Ninja Turtles in here, I love how Michelangelo saves a child from a flammable house and Leonardo saves him from dying, by giving him a mouth to mouth and he saves him. So why would I hate this film? when the effects are good and the acting is solid. Turtles saved and they prevented the war, they help people out. I think this film for me personally is better than second one and the reboot.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993) - IMDb,"Okay, I was a fan of the first movie. And, embarrassingly enough, I was sort of a fan of the second one. But this one...Okay, first off, there's NO fluid movement to the Turtles AT ALL. They look about as mechanically-enhanced as those crappy singing robots they used to have at your local Chuck E. Cheese. In several shots, you can actually SEE where the turtle mask ends and the body suit begins, thereby magically creating the illusion that this is a guy in a turtle costume. The Splinter costume/puppet/whatever is SO. BAD. In the first movie, he was nuanced and realistic, but I guess that's why the folks at Jim Henson's Creature Shop make so much. Apparently, New Line couldn't afford them anymore.The plot is... SO ridiculous. The ""writers"" send the Turtles BACK IN TIME to ancient Japan(?), a place where they don't have any villains from the comics or the cartoon. Some Japanese guys switch places with them in the present to be baby-sat by Casey Jones, and fish-out-of-water hilarity ensues (HA HA HA kill me).

Tekken (2010) - IMDb,"Look I understand Video Game movies have a stigma about them but to hate on a movie due to the lack of authenticity you should look again. The writers of this movie did the best they could to pick out the story of Tekken. What people do not understand is when a movie is made they can take liberties with the story because it is ""Based"" on characters not carbon copies. I enjoyed this film from beginning to end, some of the writing was bad and some of the actors could have been better(Movies now a days have the same issue), but you have to realize most of the actors in this film are actual MMA and martial artists. I liked how they changed things around to make sense of it all, especially for those who will be fresh to the story of Tekken. The fighting was top notch, Jin was likable, you really felt like he was an ordinary Joe. I loved the fact that the film was left open (watch after the credits).

I could sit here and kick the heck out've it for not being faithful to the game, which hooo boy it isn't, but then all I'll get is a bunch of people going ""It's Tekken The Movie, NOT Tekken The Game!"".So I'll review it as a simple action movie. The plot was thin, the character motivations were practically nil and the fight scenes were shot with far too many cuts. The acting ranged from over the top to poor.Interestingly for a movie that did not in any way respect the storyline of the game, it went out of it's way to include homages to it. Hell entire characters were in it for no more than that. Anna Williams didn't have a fight or indeed even a line! She existed for no other reason to name drop and to wander about in her underwear.

Tekkonkinkreet (2006) - IMDb,"""Tekkonkinkreet"", literally translated as reinforced concrete, is an hypnotic experience set upon the kaleidoscopic drop of some truly gorgeous drawings which tells the tale of two street urchins as they do battle with an array of colourful characters in order to defend their city from being taken over. Adapted from the three volume manga series by Taiyo Matsumoto, the film doesn't usually carry the infuriating hallmarks of a manga-to-anime switch over, which can often make the film an unenjoyable experience as the viewer struggles to come to terms with the story and characters and in the process miss the film. In this instance, any preconceptions are staved as ""Tekkonkinkreet"" absorbs the viewer all but instantly in a cacophony of animation, sound and, perhaps surprisingly, emotion.Tekkonkinkreets original manga form is what is known as a ""seinen"" manga, which is a subset of the animated genre which targets males, usually, from between the ages of eighteen and thirty, and as a twenty-four year old male myself, I perhaps enjoyed it more than others outside my demographic bracket. Ostensibly, it is a boys film as the premise bases itself on gangster films as our two street urchin protagonists, the aptly named ""Black"" and ""White"" find themselves coming into contact with an ever escalating array of Yakuza as they try to take over the ridiculously sublime ""Treasure Town"". There is a great deal of violence within the film (which while in my eyes completely justifies the progression of the film is incredibly misleading when you look at the UK Film Certificate Branding of a mere 12) as the battles waged become more intense, more bloody and more important to the survival of our two heroes. Tekkonkinkreet also utilises a much more avant-garde style of animation which we are currently beginning to see more of in the western world as an increasing acceptance of things which are outside of the ""norm"" are filtering through, and it is certainly befitting of the style. Tekkonkinkreet successfully delivers on appeasing any and all who are looking for high quality hand drawn animation which surpasses the eternally vapid conveyor belt of repetitiveness that is Pixar, but it also delivers on being more than just a ""fighting"" film.The intrinsic parts of Tekkonkinkreet prove in being the messages the director and original creator are wishing to convey to their audiences, of which there are two major points. Firstly, we have the ying and yang nature of Black and White, how their coexistence is precisely that, how they are mirror images of each other, how in essence they are two parts of the same hole and that you could be forgiven for thinking someone spliced a singular entity at birth to form two. ""Black"" is the streetwise member of the ""Cats"", as they are known within the city, as he has a savvy and cunning which has enabled he and white to be high on the Treasure Town food chain. As expected for being orphaned children, each have their issues, and with Black it is the impression that he is only one bad day away from total insanity and mental breakdown, while with ""White"" the issue is if he were to have a mental breakdown it wouldn't have much to break. White is stated as being eleven within the film yet quite clearly finds it difficult keeping a grasp on reality and his surroundings as his mental age is quite obviously, less than that. However, it is not merely how much White relies on Black for survival with the treacherous confines, but it is also how much Black relies on White, as the director twists the uses of Black and White and indeed Good and Evil as roles interchange in all quarters. Secondly, we have yet again another confrontation, another coming together of two forces yet this time it is more theory based. Treasure Town is a gloriously colourful island sitting sedately in the centre of a river yet its buildings and inhabitants for all their grandeur seem incredibly outdated. Treasure Town isn't exactly a time warp but you could be forgiven for thinking so, it is a place contented in its own time, but for the Yakuza this is not acceptable as they wish to bring Treasure Town forward into the 21st Century, to update the scenery, to turn it into a money making venture of epic proportions . This second theme resonates with a fear of old replacing new, yet the new not being perhaps as grand as everyone believes it to be, it is a fear of traditions being eradicated by a machine which has no need for sentiment, and this feeling, from both points of view, is embedded within characters on all sides of the battle. Tekkonkinkreet is a highly charged emotional film, which looks at characters interactions and dependence on each other the yings and yangs within the city itself, the coming together of old and new and more evidently, people's desire for power. The phrase ""my city"" is uttered on numerous occasions as individuals all attempt to lay claim to the treasured turf, yet none truly understanding what the phrase means or why they are saying it. Tekkonkinkreet is a highly successful anime, which blends together elements of crime, violence, humour and fantasy creating a cerebral journey for the senses as director Michael Arias superbly transcribes this moralistic tale with an energetic style of directing which perhaps possesses some of the best and ""coolest"" ""reveal"" shots in recent times. Tekkkonkinkreet is an absorbing adventure which transcends genres and blurs styles in a hot pot of beautiful angst and proves itself to be worth a watch for any who allows themselves to be enveloped by a world which is never told in black and white.",benjamin_lappin19,May/2009,8," Solid As Concrete?

Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) - IMDb,"Terminator 2: Judgment Day is (1991) is the best action sci-fi flick movie from the 90's ever made of all time. Terminator 2 is my personal favorite film I absolutely love this movie to death! Is my number 1 best movie ever till today the best of the best epic movie of all time. T2 was nominated for 4.Oscars the only movie of the franchise was nominated for an Oscar. If you watch T2 carefully and follow the story you never got bored and you are very entertained. This movie kicks ass! I love the hospital scenes mostly at night, the Cyberdyne building action sequences and of course steel mill action sequences are perfect for this film. This film deals with a lot of action, sci-fi and does involves a lot of paradox past travel. There is a lot of explosions and automatic weapons used in the movie and they are used well thousands of bullets are fired and explosive projectiles are fired at the police cars. Arnold Schwarzenegger as the good terminator T-800 did an awesome Terrific real job, he acted believably as one of his best characters I ever saw on screen. Terminator walks to the front of the building and kicks a desk out a window. Than ignores the police's order to surrender and fires a M134 Minigun with Chainsaw grip at the police cars below, avoiding the humans. The helicopter pilot moves away. Terminator than uses a M79 grenade launcher to destroy two more vehicles. Its heads-up display indicates no human casualties. The film has a heart and is the best film in the world. Robert Patrick as T-1000 is ""a mimetic Polly-alloy"" or ""liquid metal."" He can shape shift to match other people he touches, after first arriving in present time, he decides to have his base form be that of a nearby cop he killed and passes himself off as a cop in that form. The truck chase scene is awesome and the crash is also awesome. The truck that hit in to another column in the canal and explodes, T-1000 emerges as a shiny, featureless, liquid metal figure. Its features become more pronounced and its colors return to normal, returning to the form of the unharmed pseudo-cop is awesome. It shows what his character can do. Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor she acted her character perfectly here she played her character genius and very convincing and real, tough beyond all belief and completely focused on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John's safety. Sarah Connor is her best performance ever in the both Terminator films. Little out of her mind with paranoia and anger: amazingly, you see actual character development (specifically, when John and T101 arrive at Dyson's house to prevent her from doing what she wants to). Edward Furlong, is the only John Connor for me, is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who's confused by the fact that everyone except his mom told him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well. Earl Boen plays the semi-sadistic mental hospital warden Dr. Silberman from the first film The Terminator (1984) that stands between Sarah Connor and her son (until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance).Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong and Robert Patrick did there best acting performances, those actors who played there characters are beloved till this days and Terminator 2 has since been ranked as one of the greatest action, science fiction sequel films of all time. Twin sister of Linda Hamilton also appeared as Leslie Hamilton Gearren as Twin Sarah in dream she was for real there wasn't no CGI in here. Twin brothers Don Stanton and Dan Stanton both of actors appeared in here one as Lewis the Guard the other as Lewis as T-1000 who kills lewis they were for real no CGI, except special effects for T-1000 knife. Terminator special effects were designed by Stan Winston R.I.P. who has done incredible job making those effects. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments. T2 is James Cameron masterpiece. This wouldn't be an action movie without some action. James Cameron writes, produces and directs brilliantly this film. Brad Fiedel does a perfect music score to the film. American rock band Guns N' Roses wrote a single for this movie ""You Could Be Mine"" and Schwarzenegger appeared in the music video as T-800 in the music video for this movie. The chopper scene that crashed in to a SWAT van and explodes was awesome. The CGI and special effects are awesome. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task actors, stunts, puppetry, models and special effects designed from Stan Winston. It is Rated R for strong sci-fi action and violence, and for language, it is a perfect film from the 90's that I have grew up with it. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of

Thani Oruvan (2015) - IMDb,"I was Dumbstruck when I saw this movie at theater. M.Raja has indeed grown a long way from being a 'remake' director to his 'own make' director. The base script is usual one - good vs bad. But the way it has been scripted especially the bad part, deserves standing ovation!PROS:Aravind Samy - dashing stylish villain is everyones favorite and he doesn't disappoint you ! This villain is very unique! He didn't lay his hand on the protagonist at all! not even for a single shot. He carried the bad role in a subtle but powerful manner! You will surely fall in love with this character!Thambi Ramayyah - humour is different from comedy and he is the trump card in this movie who keeps on giving us some enjoyable part with his innocence. Jayam Ravi - He worked very hard for this movie! It is evident from the word go itself. This is a tailor made role for him and he did exceed the expectations.Atlast, Raja - scripting a detailed cop thriller with pacey screenplay is very difficult and he succeeds very much here!Very good movie after Thuppaki which should be watched in theaters purely for its excellence in story telling!This is a smartly made movie though not a genius film!Kudos to the whole team!

The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1978) - IMDb,"Perhaps cultural differences prevent understanding the significance and excellence of this film.The original title The 36th Chamber of Shaolin refers to San Te requesting from the Head Abbot of Shaolin permission to teach Shaolin martial skills to Han Chinese to give them the tools needed to fight the occupying Manchus of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1910) who were seen as outsiders. Chinese today still generally hate the Qing and wish that dynasty never happened, as their corruption and shortsightedness in the 20th Century was perceived to have weakened the country leading to some regions being colonized by many foreign powers at the time. Hong Kong was a colony taken by the British after humiliating the Chinese in a resounding defeat in the Opium Wars.The fact that the Hong Kong film industry made films about rebellion should be understood within this context of Hong Kong as a British Colony. Master Lau is Cantonese (as was Wong Fei-hung), so has a particular closeness to the problematic colonial relationship with the occupying British. This is why I consider this film to be an interesting example of post colonial film.This background is essential to understanding the significance of the statement made by Master Lau in this film. It is not ""just a simple revenge tale"" but the revenge is the moral and ethical response (in Chinese the technical/philosophical term is ""righteousness"" or in English best described as ""justice"") for the brutal murder of his classmates, ethics teacher, and his family. In the first part of the film, Master Killer (played by Master Lau's adopted brother, Liu Chia-hui, Master Lau's real brother plays the rebellious General Yin who fights with the ax) is studying Confucian ethics. After all their friends and family are ruthlessly slaughtered for participating in a revolt against the occupying Qing (Manchu) forces, Master Killer's friend laments that it was pointless to study ethics, as it was useless for them to save their loved ones and resist the Qings. ""No,"" Master Killer replies, ""ethics has taught us to be loyal (another Confucian term) to our loved ones, so we must get revenge. If either of us survive we MUST make it to Shaolin, learn martial arts, and get revenge!"" This political message is what makes this film more than just an arbitrary action film. In the West, actioners typically don't embed violence in such a bitter context. Here, the violence holds deep meaning within the context of foreign invasion and occupation. Here it is seen as the ethical action, which is how San Te responds to his first victim of revenge (where he meets Hung Xiguan) when his victim demands, ""You can't kill me you're a monk!"" To which San Te replies, ""Even Buddha punished evil!"" Though HK cinema had just a fraction of the budget enjoyed by the glorified garbage of most Hollywood actioners, it makes up for in dangerous political messages, unparalleled martial arts mayhem, and real martial skills of the actors. The actors in these films (like Bollywood films where the actors have to display dancing skills) actually have to do something skillful on screen as opposed to just prancing around like primadonnas. If you think the acting is overdone, this results from HK cinema arising out of Peking Opera traditions (like Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan, Yuen Biao, and Corey Yuen came out of) which has a particular style of acting that has its own idiom.Some background: This film is directed and choreographed by Master Lau (Liu Chia-liang or Lau Kar Leung). His father (and grandfather) were disciples of Butcher Wing (as depicted by Sammo Hung in The Magnificent Butcher), who was Wong Fei-hung's toughest disciple. Wong Fei-hung's style is Hung-gar, named for Hung Xiguan, (Donnie Yen plays him in the Hong Kong TV show released in the US on DVD as The Kungfu Master and Revenge of the Kungfu Master) the only disciple to survive the burning of the Shaolin Temple (there was more than one temple).For this *legendary* story (these stories form a sort of oral history in martial arts circles, but may be doubted by Western historians, who specialize in rejecting oral histories such as the Hemmings' family oral histories of Thomas Jefferson's habitual raping of his wife's half sister, Sally Hemmings) a good movie to see is Heroes Two and its sequel Disciples of Death, starring Chen Kuan Tai (a real master of Monkey Kungfu) as Hung Xiguan and Alexander Fu Sheng (the kungfu genius who tragically died in an auto accident in his prime around 1984) as Fang Shiyu (aka Fong Sai-yuk, also played by Jet Li in two movies of the same name). This film is the beginning of all these movies as it shows the history that produced San Te the first Shaolin monk to teach outsiders.I hope some of this history, background, and perspective will help viewers appreciate the greatness of this film. Other films Lau made or helped choreograph that I recommend is: The Deadly Duo, The Heroic Ones, Shaolin Mantis, Mad Monkey Kungfu, Executioners of Death, Heroes Two, its sequel: Disciples of Death, Five Masters of Death, Shaolin Martial Arts, Legendary Weapons of Kungfu, 8 Diagram Pole Fighters, Disciples of Master Killer (Master Killer III) 1984/5, Legend of Drunken Master (Drunken Master II), etc. Many of the movies he is involved with are worth watching, at least for their action even if sometimes the plot lines are a little weak.This film has it all action, drama, good characters, great plot, and some of the best fight scenes put to celluloid. DON'T SLEEP ON THIS! Though I've literally seen thousands of the best films from all over the world of all different time periods, this one is one of my all-time favorites!!

The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) - IMDb,"What an amazing experience to see The Adventures Of Robin Hood 80 years after its original release. How can one explain the longevity of its relevance.

But, look at him now, 80 years later - Erroll Flynn' s performance is as fresh today as the day he filmed it.

The Avengers (2012) - IMDb,"Marvel's The Avengers (2012) is an awesome descent MCU superhero action flick that is spectacular and a real good one. The first time I watched it on my computer I loved it. I have seen this movie many times in the row I have this film on DVD and Blu-ray. The movie features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. Joss Whedon did a fine job directing the film and I loved it is definitely in my top 10 favorite MCU superhero films. In the finale battle in New York the moment right there.. WILL NEVER... EVER.. BE AS COOL.. LIKE THIS WAS A COMIC MASTERPIECE.. I don't even read comics, but I did superheroes when I was younger.. I have a feeling justice league will never have this cohesion... this team work.. and will never be able to recreate this feeling.Robert Downey Jr. does a good job as a Iron Man he has a lot of good moments when he talks with Loki. In the third act he has to fight Thor that was cool then in the third act he had to do a lot of stuff, did the final stuff to safe the world. He is very much star of the film, that is why he number 1 star of the film he was payed a lot of more money then the other actors did ,but he deserved it he did a good job. Chris Evans as Captain America was spectacular I love his character I love how he defended and safe those people in the restaurant against Loki's army I thought that was descent. He does kick some ass when Thor hits him he uses his shield when SHIELD's ship was attacked he and Iron Man were trying to fix the ship I loved that. Mark Ruffalo was okay as The Hulk I thought he was better than Edward Norton's Hulk at least that is my opinion. Chris Hemsworth I liked him as Thor he was great. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was fantastic what does she do? She deals with the Hulk and Hawkeye the evil Hawkeye which I think is great. Jeremy Renner I like him a as an actor he is cool, he is mostly the bad guy in the film till the third act. In the third act he did a lot of cool stuff, he is cool with arrows. Loki he did fine the actor did fine as the villain I like him and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury did fine. In the film, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.The pacing to me I thought it was little boring and it was too long but the third act was really was fast paced and the movie interested how 6 superheroes become a team who turn in to Avengers I think there was a lot of action scenes in the film that were really well done. I like special effect, I had a lot of fun scenes Hulk punching Thor or punching Loki when he said is emperor. That was fun, the film it self had a lot of action it self's. It was entertaining, the CGI was really good, Robert Downey Jr. had a lot funny moments and hilarious dialogues. I have more enjoyed Captain America because he cared more about people and of course Iron Man he saved the world from Loki's invaders. I thought it was an alright and I love it. It is definitely my favorite MARVEL superhero movie.Admittedly the first half or so isn't nearly as epic as the final 30 minutes. And the plot isn't that original. But I got what I paid for with this flick, Awesome action with Earth's Mightiest Heroes kicking alien ass.The Avengers in my honest opinion was better than Man of Steel because right next year DC superman movie come out that I have hated it and I wish I could have get the money back. I am going to try and sell the movie out. Marvel's The Avengers (classified under the name Marvel Avengers Assemble in the United Kingdom and Ireland), or simply The Avengers, is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was written and directed by Joss Whedon. I have reviewed 2 years the second movie twice and as a MARVEL fan I can say I have enjoyed this movie much more than Avengers: Age of Ultron. I am waiting now on Avengers: Infinity War and of course Spider-Man: Homecoming which is a spin off Captain America: Civil War like I said I have enjoy all three Captain America Films and I enjoy both Avenger films and I love Iron Man and Iron Man Three I am one of the fans that I liked that films.

The Avengers (2012) - IMDb,"Have movies become so bad these days that a merely well-executed totally formulaic film, like ""The Avengers,"" is heralded as an exceptional film?Sure, this film hits all the marks and has some good one-liners, but once we expected films to be refreshing and new. ""Star Wars,"" while having obvious flaws, provided us a totally new universe with its own unique political conflicts, worlds, and even its own theology (the force). Its first twenty-minutes is mostly watching the story of a robotic English dandy (C3-P0) argue with a chirping rolling trashcan (R2-D2), but amazingly enough Lucas made that unique and crazy idea entertaining. The plot of ""The Avengers"" is just your run-of-the-mill comic book story-line. Compare its plot to that of ""Inception"" or ""The Matrix"" or even ""Back to the Future"" or ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" Much of what makes those films so great is that their plots are highly innovative. You have no idea where they are going. You always know exactly where ""The Avengers"" is going. Along these same lines, ""Psycho,"" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""The Matrix,"" etc. provide classic twists--Norman has gone insane and has, in his mind, become his mother, the film's apparent killer; Darth Vader, the film's main villain, is revealed to be Luke's father; the first half of ""The Matrix"" turns out to have transpired in a totally false reality. Nobody expected these twists. What unexpected occurs in ""The Avengers""? Even its minor twists have appeared in other recent films. Its most significant--Loki allowing his own capture--comes straight from ""The Dark Knight.""Gangster films before ""The Godfather"" were just pulp. ""The Godfather"" transcended the genre just as ""Unforgiven"" did with Westerns. The same is true about ""The Dark Knight."" ""The Avengers"" doesn't transcend; it regurgitates a done-to-death plot. Unlike ""The Avengers,"" ""The Dark Knight"" was more than a comic book film. It was entertaining, compelling, yet it explored complex moral ideas, and its plot went in innovative directions. Did anyone know that ""The Dark Knight"" would end not with a fistfight but instead with a battle between the Joker and Batman for Harvey Dent's soul, a scene that leaves it open to interpretation whether the Joker or Batman really won in the end, a scene far more compelling than any sequence of destruction could ever be? And did anyone NOT know that ""The Avengers"" would end with a huge battle with the Avengers ultimately triumphant? Uncertainty about how a plot will be resolved is what once kept the audience hooked, not the continual spectacle of fights and explosions. In fact, look at the IMDb Top 250. With how many of these films would you know exactly how they'd end if you were seeing them for the first time? In fact, apart from the cartoons, is there a single entry as totally formulaic as ""The Avengers"" is? And let's not forget, did you ever worry that any of the Avengers would not survive? If not, then where was the real dramatic tension? One of the things that made ""The Dark Knight"" so compelling is that one of its two heroes not only dies but is also believably turned evil before he is killed. And did anyone expect what happened to Rachel Dawes, Harvey Dent's girlfriend? One of the things that made ""Psycho"" so dramatic is its main protagonist dies halfway through the film. Great films--serious or fun--must make the audience feel that there is something truly at stake. And do I even have to go into how voting to give ""The Avengers"" a 10 places it on par with the all-time great works of film art--""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" ""Schindler's List,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Citizen Kane"", ""Vertigo,"" ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" ""8 1/2,"" ""Manhattan,"" ""Cinema Paradiso"" etc.? A vote of 10 for a film like this diminishes the worth of these works of art that explore the deepest issues concerning the human condition.Though I've brought up some films that are darker than ""The Avengers"" or more serious, that is not my complaint about ""The Avengers"" at all. ""Star Wars, "" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""Back to the Future,"" ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" were fun movies, but they also had plots that went in unexpected directions, had surprising twists, introduced us to unique characters. The elements I've listed here are what make a film exceptional and deserving of an incredibly high rating. Just a well-done totally formulaic movie like ""The Avengers"" simply does not deserve the praise it is getting. Of course this film does not deserve a 1 out of 10. I would really give it 3 or maybe 3 1/2 out of 5 stars, which is equivalent to a 6 or 7 out of 10 on the IMDb rating scale. However, until others don't alter their votes to put ""The Avengers"" more in line with where it should be in comparison to other great entertaining films of history, my vote will remain a 1. Go watch ""The Avengers"" a few more times. Once you've gotten used to the 3-D, the special effects, the digital surround sound, you'll see that the film is predictable, the jokes are so-so, and the violence of the fights and of the long climactic end battle actually gets kind of boring.If you're a teenager still reading comics or a lover of comic books who's always dreamed of watching Hulk fight Thor, Thor fight Iron Man, then this movie is what you've always been waiting for, but for the rest of us, ""The Avengers"" is not the tour de force it's been made out to be. Oh wait a sec. I just learned that there's a movie based on ""Battleship""--you know, that dull board game for eight-year-olds. I guess movies really are that bad. If you compare ""The Avengers"" only to garbage like that, I guess it really does seem great.Never mind...",thefilmexpert30,April/2012,1, Are movies so bad now that a film like this is considered

The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi (2003) - IMDb,"Zatoichi is the updated version of cult Japanese show some decades back.Here a blind swordsman goes to a small town controlled by a ruthless gang and abuses the people there. There he meets many characters like the siblings on a mission, a samurai who is hired by the gang, as well as an unlucky gambler who befriends the blind swordsman.          This is the first ever Takeshi Kitano film I have ever seen and I got to say it turned out to be a rather pleasant surprise. Prior to this I have heard so much about Kitano's work and was really expecting to see a really good film. Add to that every samurai film I see normally gets compared to Kurosawa's works like Rashomon, and Ran which of course are tough acts to follow. I thought the film was well made in many aspects. The cinematography was really beautiful and well made. The costumes like most period films were finely crafted and were beautiful. The scoring was also very good.         I always find it rather hard to laugh in a film that is non-English. I guess I always believed that humour doesn't always transcend different cultures. What may be funny for one may seem rather dull in another. This film however debunks that thought.  I found myself laughing over a lot of scenes in the film. Even in scenes where you do not think there could be a funny moment Kitano is able to deliver one just to break the tension a little.        The fight scenes in this film were also well planned and I though it was done realistically but not necessarily done to shock the audiences with bucket loads of blood and mangled body parts. It was effective but not too disturbing.        I also thought that the overall story of the film was good. I was particularly interested with the story of the siblings and it's eventual resolution at the end of the movie.        Takeshi Kitano's Zatoichi is a great film which now ranks as one of my and hopefully it will be to other people.

The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi (2003) - IMDb,"I just finished watching this film and am surprised that it has received such a good rating on IMDb. The first problem I had was with the Zatoichi character. Zatoichi played originally by Shintaro Katsu, was humble, had a subtle humour, the seemingly bungling master swordsman. This to me is what made him a memorable character. This new Zatoichi is simply ruthless with little of the honour he should have, seems to look for a fight, doesn't speak much, has no humanity and therefore is hard to warm up to.The plot was my second problem. Those who enjoy the original films or TV series know that one of the best things about them is how the plots are well crafted... Zatoichi 2003 was not even close in this respect.Third was the shoddy secondary character development. For instance we were introduced to the ""bodyguard"" and his ailing wife and we want to sympathize with them, but then the film went nowhere with their development to make us feel anything for them. The big internal conflict in the viewer when Zatoichi meets the bodyguard in combat should be: how will I feel if this guy, who is just trying to make money to heal his sick wife, is cut down? Going into this fight, the answer is... well, not much. Fourth was the absolutely ridiculous modern tap hip-hop dance sequence at the end - what was that about?!? Embarrassing and completely out of step with the rest of the film.Also of note, I was under the impression this was set in the 16th century, but a revolver was pulled in one scene. A small thing but it bothered me.One the whole very disappointing, as a film in general and especially when compared to the originals.",wandering-star12,December/2006,3, They don't make Zatoichi like they used to,0,"[finish, watch, film, surprised, receive, good, rating, imdb, first, problem, zatoichi, character, zatoichi, played, originally, shintaro, katsu, humble, subtle, humour, seemingly, bungling, master, swordsman, make, memorable, character, new, zatoichi, simply, ruthless, little, honour, seems, look, fight, speak, much, humanity, therefore, hard, warm, plot, second, problem, enjoy, original, film, tv, series, know, one, best, thing, plot, well, craft, zatoichi, even, close, shoddy, secondary, character, development, instance, introduce, bodyguard, ail, wife, want, sympathize, film, go, nowhere, development, make, u, feel, anything, big, internal, conflict, viewer, zatoichi, meet, bodyguard, combat, feel, guy, try, make, money, heal, sick, wife, cut, go, fight, answer, well, ...]","[i, just finished watching, this film, am surprised, that, it, has received such, a good rating, on, imdb, the first problem i, had was, with, the zatoichi character, zatoichi, played, originally, by, shintaro katsu, was, humble, had, a subtle humour, seemingly bungling, master swordsman, to, me, is, made, him a memorable character, this new zatoichi, is, simply ruthless, with, little, of, the honour he, should have, seems, to, look, for, a fight, does not speak, much, has, no humanity, therefore is, hard, to, warm, up, to.the plot, was, my second problem, enjoy, the original films, tv series know, that, of, the best things, about, them, is, how, the plots, are well crafted, zatoichi, was not even close, in, this respect.third, was, the shoddy secondary character development, for, instance we, were introduced, to, bodyguard, his ailing wife, we, want, to, sympathize, with, them, then, the film, went, nowhere, with, their development, to, make, us, feel anything, for, them, the big internal conflict, in, the viewer, ...]",-50.879378476118276,-6.380026611601454,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,3,2,0,0,4,4,0,2,0,4,4,2,5.875,112,134,finished watching film surprised received good rating imdb first problem zatoichi character zatoichi played originally shintaro katsu humble subtle humour seemingly bungling master swordsman made memorable character new zatoichi simply ruthless little honour seems look fight speak much humanity therefore hard warm plot second problem enjoy original films tv series know best things plots well crafted zatoichi 2003 even close respect third shoddy secondary character development instance introduced bodyguard ailing wife want sympathize film went nowhere development us feel anything big internal conflict viewer zatoichi meets bodyguard combat feel guy trying money heal sick wife cut going fight answer well much fourth absolutely ridiculous modern tap hip hop dance sequence end embarrassing completely step rest film note impression set 16th century revolver pulled scene small thing bothered whole disappointing film general especially compared originals,0.0211326433982684,0.49333400974025976,1

The Bourne Identity (2002) - IMDb,"I have grown extremely tired of the typical formula spy film like Bond, or the juvenile stunt exhibition ""Triple X."" There have been a bare handful of spy films that feature relatively realistic spy thrillers, especially recently with a concentration on spectacular movies that have less substance than cotton candy.Besides ""The Bourne Identity,"" ""Ronin"" is the only other recent spy movie I can think of that didn't feature skydiving, bungie jumping, skiing downhill while shooting innumerable bad guys, laser pens, cars with ejection seats, or silicone breasted women with names you'd be vaguely embarrassed to say in front of your mother. Most of the crap that passes for an espionage film has no plot or reason for existing other than to meet a quota of explosions and cleavage in order to draw the summer action film crowd.While ""Bourne"" does not have a particularly deep plot, it is consistent and focused. The focus is entirely upon Bourne and how he is to deal with having no memory of his past, being hunted without knowing why. Some people have complained about being confused by the movie. I for one, do not need to have everything spelled out since in many cases this smacks of unreality in the first place; the essence of espionage is drawing conclusions from very sketchy information. If you can't handle a little of that, you probably should stick to Disney films or TV's Scooby Doo where everything is explained in the end. We never find out about what is in the case in ""Ronin"" and I can live without some information being filled in about Bourne's past.To those who have moaned about the incompatibility of the book and the movie, seek help. There are probably several things that work in the book that would either be boring and take too much screen time to explain, or would be viewed as cliche to modern screen audiences. As I remember, I liked the book, and I definitely like this movie. I view any movie adaptation as an interpretation of the book rather than a translation from words to pictures anyway.As for realism, most of the action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets are to be seen, no incredibly lovely models fall madly in bed with Bourne, and the hero shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competance. As someone who has trained in martial arts for over 10 years, unrealistic fight scenes are a pet peeve. The fights in ""Bourne"" are fast, nasty, and very realistic while still being entertaining for the layman. (And yes, taking a gun away from some idiot who is standing well within your striking radius without getting shot is definitely doable, though I had serious doubts until we tested it for ourselves with plastic dart guns in the dojo several years ago).While not being perfect, ""The Bourne Identity"" is, simply put, several grades above the typical spy film.

The Boy and the Beast (2015) - IMDb,"Mamoru Hosoda has come a long way since his Digimon (1999-2003) days. He's been steadily rising through the ranks and in the hearts and minds of anime fans with his cult Samurai Champloo (2004-2005) series and three very memorable feature length movies over the last decade. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (2006) made a lasting impression to be sure, but Wolf Children (2012) remains in this writer's mind one of the most insightful and sublime anime films ever. It rivals the delicate balancing of themes that make Ghibli Studios so popular yet instead of children's stories, Hosoda dabbles in adult themes making Hosoda more of a contemporary to the late Satochi Kon.The Boy and the Beast continues the animator's winning streak providing a soulful coming-of-age tale through killer action sequences and clever thematic liberties. Ren (Sometani/Vale), a pre- teen with a bad attitude has run away from home after the death of his mother. Angry, spiteful and living on the streets of Shibuya, Japan, Ren discovers a portal to Jutengai: The Beast Kingdom where anthropomorphic creatures roam free. Inadvertently, he's entangled in a feud between two powerful warriors vying for Lord of Jutengai. The first is Iozen (Yamaji/Hennigan), a wise and popular swordsman who fathers two children and apprentices many talented disciples. The second is Kumatetsu (Yakusho/Swasey) a powerful but temperamental and lonely warrior followed only by Tatara (Oizumi/Sinclair) his wise-cracking buddy. Partially out of desperation and partially out of spite, Ren apprentices with Kumatetsu and slowly learns the martial art of Kendo.The central conflict in Boy and the Beast ignites when Ren and Kumatetsu butt heads while training. Kumatetsu it should be noted, starts out as a very poor teacher angrily screeching ""reach for the sword in your soul!"" and other such nonsensical things. Kaede (Hirose/Apprill), the wise monk of the village informs Ren (nicknamed Kyuta) that his master had to learn everything himself without help. Thus he became independent yet unable to teach. It is only when Ren starts to mimic Kumatetsu and anticipate his moves, do they both start training in harmony.The other central conflict is the internal struggle Ren battles with as he grows older. The citizens of Jutengai claim humans do not belong as they have an inner darkness. Ren's darkness manifests itself in a shadow with an open pit in his chest. This ghostly figure however is tempered by the arrival of Hyakushubo (Franky/Organ), a high-school girl who encourages him to focus on other things besides fighting. While venturing between the human and animal realm, Ren takes an interest in reading and is taught by Hyakushubo who shows patience in ways Kumatetsu never could. It is this connection as well as his re-connection with his father, that Ren is ultimately able to become whole.Boy and the Beast features some incredibly detailed, almost photographic background art. One could watch this film on mute and still be enveloped by the beauty of the world surrounding Ren, Kumatetsu and Hyakushubo. Only Satochi Kon's Tokyo Godfathers (2003) has ever reached this level of mastery and all due credit should be given to the animators. Even little throw away habitats such as the montage of our plucky heroes meeting with ""the wise masters,"" are awe-inspiring. Out of all the adornment however, the climax remains the most visually impressive part which more than makes-up for any narrative issues.And yes there are some slight narrative issues. Elaborate swordplay and exciting, detailed animation aside, the third act tends to go on a tangent only loosely connected to the story at-large. We're made privy to a long festering rivalry that seems to come out of left field and are given certain rules a little too late in the game. The whole third act could have taken up the contents of a whole new movie; a sequel perhaps. Instead it's squeezed in like descriptors in a Herman Melville story.Most people are blessed to have one person in their lives who inspires them to follow their dreams while arming them with the discipline to make those dreams a reality. Ren is given three over the course of Boy and the Beast. The first is Kumatetsu who despite his gruffness would sacrifice everything for Ren if given the chance. The second is Hyakushubo; a kind young girl who not only teaches Ren how to read but encourages him to reach for more and never be afraid of failure. The last is Ren himself; the only one who can reflect on the choices he's made and give him the motivation to learn from those choices. We may not always have a choice about what happens to us but we do have a choice on how we react, adapt and grow with each opportunity. With that Boy and the Beast illustrates it's most important lesson; you too can be your own hero.",bkrauser-81-3110648,March/2016,8," Incredibly Detailed, Stunningly Realized",1,"[mamoru, hosoda,

The Breath (2009) - IMDb,"I was browsing the reviews of ""Nefes"", and since there was only a handful of reviews by non-Turkish IMDb users - since it hasn't been screened much outside Turkey - I felt that I had to give my effort to it. Having said that, I feel that it's been badly misunderstood by many people. Many reviewers judged it as ""propaganda"" or ""morally corrupted"" etc. I couldn't disagree more.To me it wasn't even political, even less morally corrupted - disturbing and even revolting - yes. Corrupted - not even remotely. I might even call it pacifistic. The story is a deep and humane view in to the persona of a soldier. I don't say Turkish soldier, because the moral issues of it are so universal - basically the story could be placed in any war throughout the modern history.**Minor spoiler* Most of the critic on IMDb were about the parts were the Turkish special forces (the main characters) were shown doing unjustified violence to their unarmed prisoner. That's the ""morally corrupted propaganda"" part I guess. The way I see it, it's as anti-propaganda as it gets. It puts the main characters to same line as their enemies. It doesn't try to glorify or justify either sides part on the situation. How's that propaganda? **In a nutshell: Nefes is a visually sublime look in to the social and emotional aspects that drive young men to sacrifice their lives and futures for something as dreadful as war. It's about the brutal effects of violence to ones psyche. And mainly - It's about the endless amounts of everyday tragedies that drive so many of these emotionally fragile young men to see the war as their only option in life.",lefaikone28,January/2010,9, The unspoken aspects war,1,"[browsing, review, nefes, since, handful, review, imdb, user, since, screen, much, outside, turkey, felt, give, effort, say, feel, badly, misunderstood, many, people, many, reviewer, judged, propaganda, morally, corrupt, etc, could, disagree, even, political, even, less, morally, corrupt, disturb, even, revolt, yes, corrupt, even, remotely, might, even, call, pacifistic, story, deep, humane, view, persona, soldier, say, turkish, soldier, moral, issue, universal, basically, story, could, place, war, throughout, modern, history, critic, imdb, part, turkish, special, force, main, character, show, unjustified, violence, unarmed, prisoner, morally, corrupt, propaganda, part, guess, way, see, get, put, main, character, line, enemy, try, glorify, justify, either, side, part, ...]","[i, was browsing, the reviews, of, nefes, since, was, only, a handful, of, reviews, by, non-turkish imdb users, since, it, has not been screened, much, outside, turkey, i, felt, that, i, had, to, give, my effort, to, it, having said, that, i feel, that, it, is been badly misunderstood, by, many people, many reviewers, judged, it, as, propaganda, morally corrupted, i, could not disagree, more.to me it, was, not even political, even less morally corrupted, disturbing and even revolting, corrupted, not even remotely, i, might even call, it, pacifistic, the story, is, deep and, humane view, in to, the persona, of, a soldier, i, do not say, turkish soldier, because, the moral issues, of, it, are, so universal, basically, the story, could be placed, in, any war, throughout, the modern history.**minor spoiler, most, of, the critic, on, imdb, were, about, the parts, were, the turkish special forces, the main characters, were shown doing, unjustified violence, to, their unarmed prisoner, is, morally corrupted, propaganda, part i, guess, ...]",-47.73013818672579,1.623215778487193,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,3,2,0,0,4,4,0,2,0,4,4,2,6.05607476635514,107,141,browsing reviews nefes since handful reviews non turkish imdb users since screened much outside turkey felt give effort said feel badly misunderstood many people many reviewers judged propaganda morally corrupted etc could disagree even political even less morally corrupted disturbing even revolting yes corrupted even remotely might even call pacifistic story deep humane view persona soldier turkish soldier moral issues universal basically story could placed war throughout modern history minor spoiler critic imdb parts turkish special forces main characters shown unjustified violence unarmed prisoner morally corrupted propaganda part guess way anti propaganda gets puts main characters line enemies glorify justify either sides part situation propaganda nutshell nefes visually sublime look social emotional aspects drive young men sacrifice lives futures something dreadful war brutal effects violence ones psyche mainly endless amounts everyday tragedies drive many emotionally fragile young men war option life,-0.04390756302521009,0.3614145658263305,0

I did actually feel sorry to see some of them die which is unusual in a film like this. The characters weren't flat, which was a lovely surprise. Of course it is extremely clichéd with the group going into a cabin with a creepy basement and so forth. This is the type of horror film ""The Cabin in the Woods"" was warning us of! The dogs are also quite funny as I do not find dogs scary in the slightest, especially when they're as cute as these ones!

The Breed (2006) - IMDb,"Movie concepts don't get much simpler than this: on a supposedly deserted island, genetically enhanced, rabid-like dogs attack five college kids who have gone there for a weekend of fun. It's kind of surprising that a movie like this, made in 2006, still gets theatrical release in some countries; this is usually direct-to-DVD stuff. With that said, however, ""The Breed"" is effective at what it sets out to do. What gives this movie an edge over other contemporary ""creature features"" is that the ""creatures"" are real, highly-trained dogs instead of fake CGI bats, crocodiles, snakes, spiders or whatever. This adds an element of realism to the proceedings, as does the fact that the characters behave rationally for the most part. Michelle Rodriguez looks great (what else is new?) and shows her physicality, and the rest of the cast may not be brilliant, but they're not bad, either.

The Cave (2005) - IMDb,"The opening sequence with a group of men breaking into an old monastery is wonderful. Weird forms in the walls and floors promise that the place has been guarding some terrible secret. Unfortunately an avalanche/earthquake destroys the building and send the men into a deep dark cave where there are monsters. Some years later the ruins are being excavated and the cave is discovered. Its so big that there might be something there, especially since there appears to be a river of some sort that runs a hundred miles underground. A team of specialists is brought in and soon everyone is trapped underground and underwater, including the beasts.For the early portion of this movie I was a bit confused by the critical drubbing that this movie took. Sure it wasn't the best movie ever, but it wasn't that bad. Unfortunately as time went on I began to get very lost, I got to the point where I wasn't sure what I was seeing. The problem is that the film is very dark and its often filmed in tight shots that re-enforce the claustrophobic nature of where the cast is suppose to be. Worse everyone in the cast blends together so once everyone got underground and in similar wet suits I had no idea who anyone was except there was a blonde girl, a brunette girl, an old guy, a black guy, a Japanese guy, and a bunch of white guys. The combination of the dark confused camera work with the clone like cast had me rapidly lose interest because I had no idea what was going on or who anyone was. I got to the point where I stopped caring. To be honest I got lost as to what was going on and stuck with it just to see the monsters.Its a shame the film making isn't better or more coherent since the monsters are mostly quite good. These beasts are what makes the movie worth seeing. Sure there are some that look like rubber toys but some of the big guys look absolutely stunning.

The Cold Light of Day (2012) - IMDb,"I went to see this film after I saw an initial rating on here of 8 out of 10, but let me tell you it is very, very poor.The film is littered with blatant product placement to the point that I thought at some points I was watching a slick advert. The first of these adverts is when the film lead stops to buy a drink of coke for no reason and proceeds to slowly drink it with the can taking up most of the screen, really just like an advert.This was a little annoying but I kept hope that this was a small issue in what could become a very good film. Unfortunitly it didn't and car and phone adverts continued through the film. The script was poor and events unbelievable. Most of the action scenes you will have seen copied from Bourne or other action movies but made laughably similar but much worse. The acting from weaver was poor, although I am not sure if the blame lies with sigourney or the director. To be honest Bruce Willis is by far the best actor and carries the film for the first 20min giving some hope it will become a good action film, unfortunately it did not.I have never walked out on a film but after a number of laugh out loud moments ( at the film ), I was seriously contemplating it.

The Count of Monte Cristo (2002) - IMDb,"I really didn't appreciate this film until the second viewing. Afterwards, I thought, ""Wow, that was really a satisfying, great film to watch."" Satisfying, of course, to see the typical good guy-gets-revenge tale but also a film which provided some beautiful scenery and photography all the way through: a real treat for the eyes and must-see on a widescreen DVD.I also put on the English subtitles on the second viewing in parts, which helped me understand a few things I missed on the first viewing and had made the film just a bit confusing in several parts. That was cleared up, and the rest was just enjoying the scenery and performances.Most fun to watch was Richard Harris as ""Priest,"" the longtime prisoner who tutors young Jim Caviezel, the man (Edmond Dantes) unjustly imprisoned who exacts his revenge in the last hour of the movie. Yes, Harris' teaching stretched credibility as he seems to teach his pupil about everything there is know in life! Harris, too, had some of the best lines in the movie, several very profound statements. Ironic that he would be giving Caviezel - who two years later was playing Jesus in ""The Passion Of The Christ"" - sermons about believing in God! That's Hollywood! One film you're an atheist, the next you are God.For those who might think the first 30-40 minutes of this movie are a bit slow, stay with it as the action picks up once Caviezel escapes from the prison. Shortly afterward, he is aided by the other character I found most fun to watch, played by Luis Gusman, who still sounds like he's more at home in the streets of New York but, once again, you suspend belief and just go along for the ride.Strange how our human nature makes revenge so sweet when forgiveness is the right thing to do, but Hollywood has always capitalized on this human failing, making enjoyable films like this. To be fair, it isn't just revenge, as this film points out, it's ""justice"" we all like to see.

Too many characters were stereotypes, mainly concepts represented by human bodies, and actors not doing a good job at portraying them.

The Crow: City of Angels (1996) - IMDb,"I adore the original film that starred Brandon Lee as the avenging angel brought back from the dead. Now a sequel was probably inevitable, and I remember being largely disappointed by it with its wearily cut-up story, dour performances and diluted action. Well nothing has changed the second time around. Again I can't knock that killer hard-rock / industrial sounding soundtrack, haunting score and the dark, Gothic embellishment creating an atmospherically catastrophe post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. It's dirty, smoggy and jarringly bleak. Jean Yves Escoffier's cinematography lenses it with the right free-spirited. However there's nothing overly memorable, or even powerfully gripping to draw any real emotion and interest form the suffocatingly drab and unimaginative narrative. By following the same patterns of the original's tragedy, it doesn't lay any new groundwork. It was a tediously repetitive mess that seemed more fantasy-based and conjures up a script that's weakly penned. Vincent Perez's avenging soul is unconvincingly void in a tortured performance, which doesn't create much heart-ache or grace. There's no imprint, or witty charisma that Lee evoked. Honestly I didn't feel anything. Richard Brooks flimsily strolls by with no impressionable stance as the head villain. Mia Kirshner gives a sound performance and Iggy Pop delightfully chews up the scenery to spit it out. Director Tim Pope can formulate some flourishing visuals and lasting poses, but when it came to setting everything in motion. Flat and unexciting comes to mind. His action set-pieces lacked zest and seemed to plod like they're sliced up music video clips. Never did it infuse any real sense of energy, thrills and urgency.

The Crow: Salvation (2000) - IMDb,"I love ""The Crow,"" and there's not much in my mind that could be done in a sequel to top it. ""Salvation,"" unlike ""City of Angels,"" doesn't try to top the first one, or rip it off... The characters are solid, the performances are great, and the action is non-stop. But what singles this movie out is the story. It's a good story, not just another ""Crow"" movie. The direction of the film reminds me of the first, very dark, yet crisp (not gritty like the 2nd), and the trick camera angles mixed with the impressive special effects keep the supernatural elements alive as the very human story rolls along.I work at a video store, and I see all kinds of movies that bypass theatres and come direct to video, and usually there's something about them that tells you why, even the good ones. This had the look and feel of something that, if released at the appropriate time, would have done well in the theatres. It wouldn't have been a smash hit, and it certainty wouldn't bring in as many people as the original did, but it deserves much better than this.If you're fans of the franchise, I highly recommend that you see this. If you like the first one, but that's it, then expand your horizons a little and try to see this for what it is, and not what you thought it would be.

The Crow: Salvation (2000) - IMDb,"Now, the main problem with this film was the plot. It wasn't the actors, because they actually did a decent job. It wasn't the director, because it seemed like he knew what he was doing. It was the plot, plain and simple, the plot. First off, Corvis turning into the crow? No, didn't work for me. I didn't feel for these characters at all to tell the truth. The script didn't develop them as well as the first ""Crow"" did. So that was a major problem, I didn't feel that Corvis and Lauren had a strong love because they repeatedly showed the same loving scene between them. ""Was that their only romantic moment?"" I thought. See, the first ""Crow"" showed many memories of Shelly and Eric that were loving and touching, it showed how much they loved each other and it would never die.Another problem I had was the make up was naturally on Corvis and didn't give any depth to his anger on the murder of his girlfriend. Kirsten Dunst seemed really out of place and was just another copy off of Sarah from the first ""Crow"". The villains, they were not that disturbing.Everything just didn't go in depth enough for me to care. For the ""Crow"" fans, I would recommend to complete the trilogy.

The Dark Knight (2008) - IMDb,"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy.

The Dark Knight Rises (2012) - IMDb,"After eight years in seclusion, Batman resurfaces to face Bane, a mastermind bent on destroying Gotham and has ties to Bruce Wayne's past. Christopher Nolan's conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolan's approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense and that's its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman's arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman's most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman's most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority—forget the Bane you saw in ""BATMAN & ROBIN"". Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly.

The Dark Knight Rises (2012) - IMDb,"What makes things worse, is that its predecessors were basically intricate works of genius, but TDKR lacks essentially everything that made The Dark Knight (particularly) one of the greatest superhero movies ever produced. On top of all this, everyone's bandwagoning on thinking it's great because it's ""supposed"" to be great, right?!?! How could Nolan's finale not be a masterpiece?! Well, I'll tell you...Bruce Wayne acts out-of-character from not just the first two movies, but from the comic as well. Catwoman's motivation and place in the story is weak, flat, and forced. For a movie that's almost three hours long, you only get about 20 minutes of Batman in costume (if you're lucky). The movie jumps in weird time increments that are mildly confusing, but mostly forced to facilitate its wanna-be epic nature. As for more heavily SPOILERY observations...Commissioner Gordon is barely in the movie, spending most his time injured in a hospital, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character comes out of the blue and does what you'd expect the Commissioner to be doing... solution- COMBINE THE TWO CHARACTERS!!! The two Batman vs. Bane fights are flat and boring as hell. Bane is a cardboard, unexplored (until a late-third act flashback... of all ridiculous cliché plot devices) character that reaches for sympathy in one of the most embarrassing, wanna-be-tender, totally out-of-place, extremely laughable scenes I've ever seen in my life- HE FRIGGIN' CRIES?!!?!? Every single, yes EVERY SINGLE cop in Gotham marches down into the sewers on a tip that Bane's raising a secret army, only to have all the entrances blown up so they can be trapped down there... for like three months. Reread that last sentence and tell me what part of it makes sense.Bane holds Gotham hostage with a 4 megaton nuclear device, after blowing up all but one bridge leading into and out of the city, for three months and the U.S. government does nothing. Seriously, nothing. It's said they negotiated a truce and had FEMA send in supplies for survival. Read that last paragraph and tell me what part of it makes sense.The ""real"" villain reveals him/her self in an absurd Act 3 ""twist"" that's followed by a narrated flashback (the same one that leads to Bane CRYING), and throughout the entire monologue Batman sits there doing nothing after a knife has been thrust/held into his side.After the 2nd lame Bats/Bane fight, the bulk of the late Act 3rd ""action sequence"" consists of little more than Batman flying around in that weird-looking clunky flying thing that supposed to be the Bat Plane- half of which is of him outmaneuvering missiles that the bulky ""plane"" couldn't have possibly eluded.I really, really, really, really, really, really wanted to not just like this, but LOVE it, but as it progressed the enthusiasm cloud gradually cleared to the point of my being utterly flabberghasted in disappointment- mostly because I can't believe the director of The Dark Knight and the masterpiece that is Inception was responsible for this movie.

The Darkest Hour (2011) - IMDb,"While maybe not much better than what the ratings and reviews say, at the very least 'The Darkest Hour' has the fun factor going for it. There is not much for a plot: your typical alien invasion, where a group of survivors have to try and survive the attack while in Moscow.Wait, Moscow?One of the things I liked here was that there IS originality. Instead of another American city, or even Tokyo/London, this time around we watch Moscow under attack. Instead of having to see the characters running and hiding around the same New York for the nth time, we are presented an 'unknown' scenario that has a lot of charm going for it.Another plus is the aliens themselves. Not your typical armor-wearing soldiers or 'greys', but in here they have a very original design (bodyless masses of light). It is sad to hear the clichèd excuse for their invasion, but they are very interesting to see.Despite these flairs of originality, overall the film suffers from the typical B-movie sci-fi problems. The blandness of the cast and some logic-defying situations/developments (every Russian they meet speak perfect English, for example) are downsides, but the straight-forward plot, lack of an overly pretentious message and non-boring development more than compensate.Overall, this is far from a great film but it is a fun straight-forward B-movie with some welcome flashes of originality.

The Darkest Hour (2011) - IMDb,"Granted I wasn't expecting a great deal from The Darkest Hour, where the trailers have probably spelt out the entire film from beginning to end, and more than validated it to be nothing but a special effects extravaganza. Then again, what you have already seen is it, as The Darkest Hour indeed is the darkest in terms of filmmaking, having nothing else served up to excite nor to thrill, sticking to what would be a rote storyline packaged hundreds of times over.The selling point of the film is of course Timur Bekmambetov's name on the credits, a filmmaker who had made everyone sit up and take notice of his inventive, stylish science fiction films out of Russia - Night Watch and Day Watch - that Hollywood had come wooing, and from then on it's either producer creds to help boost some languishing production, or allowing the filmmaker to helm his own like in Wanted. Not everything he touches turns to gold of course, and sadly The Darkest Hour boasted what could have been something he could have done, but ultimately falling very flat on its face because of the lack of freshness in its story, written by Leslie Bohem, M.T. Ahem and Jon Spaihts, who also had screenplay responsibilities.The premise is as bland as you can get, and frankly can work in any other major city if not for the exoticness of Moscow, and Bekmambetov's connection of course. The characters too can be anyone other than the software engineering duo Sean (Emile Hirsch) and Ben (Max Minghella) who flew halfway across the world to find out they were outplayed by their Swedish competitor Skyler (Joel Kinnaman), and two holidaying teenage girls Natalie (Olivia Thirlby) and Anne (Rachael Taylor), who all got together in a hip pub, only for what could have led to respective one night stands interrupted by a parade of lights falling from the sky, which from the trailer you will know contain some mean, invisible aliens out to annihilate all of humankind for our energy.Yes you read that right, invisible aliens. They have this innate ability to light up bulbs activate anything that's run by electricity, since it's a signature they carry, before being allowed to reveal something extra in the final few scenes. Sure, something invisible would work in playing up our fears, but the way director Chris Gorak did it, his inexperience shows. Similar genre films like Attack The Block built anticipation nicely, but here we get nothing of that sort of emotional engagement, as it teases through elements that suggest vulnerability and chinks in the adversary's armour, force fields of sorts that are entirely resistant to whatever arsenal us humans can throw at it, if we can get to realize their positions first.The plot could have been written by any newbie hack sent packing home to watch countless of alien invasion and monster movies, to be able to come up with something that's really quite plain and lacking true suspense. In some ways it's like an amalgamation of science fiction films from I am Legend to other contemporary alien invasion type movies, except that we don't give a hoot too much for the characters involved here, so much so that the filmmakers have the audacity and courage to ensure equal opportunity to become alien fodder, which is a rarity.Effects wise, this two trick pony will soon wear out its novelty, the first of which is the way the aliens turn humans and all living creatures into swirling dust upon contact, and the second of which is an electrical whip-like probe that goes feeling around for lifeforms. Nothing terribly original here, and after a while these limited bag of tricks do become a little stale. As for its 3D presentation, there's only depth of field, getting human dust falling all over, as well as having exploding debris hurtle toward the screen. Some large scale effects like collapsing walls and huge probes to siphon Earth's resources still looked a little bit raw,Perhaps then if you're looking for any sliver of merit to watch this, it will be for the on- location shoots in Russia, as well as having this film mark what would be a rare treat at having Russian soldiers/mercenaries in action up against the enemy compared to the usual US led war machinery in any alien invasion film, and this one also marking a USA-Russia collaboration amongst survivors in this post-cold war era. But you need not have to look that deep into this film, because it's indeed a struggle to find something unique and of narrative quality, failing which The Darkest Hour is only at best a mediocre film

The Fugitive (1993) - IMDb,"Nothing is more thrilling to see than two characters with superior intelligences, pitting their wits against each other. A thriller does not require a great deal of plot or techno-babble to be involving or complex, although many distributors of blockbusters today seem to think so. For these reasons, ""The Fugitive"" is a huge blessing for a movie critic such as I. I was just thrilled by the excitement, the performances by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, and the whole Hitchcockian aura that this sensational film delivered. Even though we have been seeing too many films based on television series come out lately, ""The Fugitive"" is certainly not one of those that we can add to that routine bushel.Ford is Dr. Richard Kimble, a vascular surgeon who is wrongfully accused for the brutal murder of his wife (Sela Ward), and therefore sentenced to be executed. After escaping from a bus crash/trash collision, he finds himself running from the Chicago police and especially the U.S. Marshall service, led by Lt. Gerard (Oscar-winner Tommy Lee Jones). At the same time, Kimble attempts to prove his innocence and in turn discover who did kill his wife. What ensues is a tangled web of medical conspiracies, along with a search for a notorious ""one-armed man."" As I have stated, this is a simple plot that requires no superficial decoration.Ford, who has always been a less dramatic presence in movies and more of a subtle but affected persona, fits the part of Kimble perfectly. With this role, the last thing required is a melodramatic actor that sticks out like a sore thumb. Ford casually settles into the role of the man on the run, bringing intelligence and style to a less ostentatious character. Jones, who has never really been considered a headliner until now, creates a character that is extremely humorous but also calmly diligent. His only goal is to carry out the task he is assigned to, and nothing will stand in his way, least of all a rivaling police force or Richard Kimble himself. One of the fascinating Hitchcockian elements of the film is how it allows its audience to not be able to take sides. We are constantly rooting for both Ford and Jones when either of them come into perspective. We familiarize with both of them and are amused by both equally. The film's finale, which I won't dare give away, satisfies both sides of this rooting coin.I have not previously been a fan of the director Andrew Davis's work, but with this entry, he certainly has sparked my interest. With such films as ""Under Siege,"" ""Code of Silence,"" and ""Above the Law,"" he has been able to work with action stars that are both larger than life (Seagal, Norris). Here, he uses more intrigue and atmosphere to reach his audience, building suspense and excitement through simple film tools rather than things blowing up or guns going off (However, there is a phenomenal opening crash scene to boot). With quick pacing, a never-a-dull-moment storyline, and great actors, ""The Fugitive"" ranks itself as one of the best action films of this decade, and definitely one of the best films of 1993.

The General (1926) - IMDb,"Probably Buster Keaton's best film, and oddly enough, it's not even a straightforward comedy  it's actually an action film, with clever doses of romance and comedy tossed in for good measure.  `The General', which is set during the Civil War, is about a train engineer named Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton, of course) who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army . . . and is turned down because the army feels he'd be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier.  However, through a series of misunderstandings, both Johnny's family and his girl think he's a coward, and they refuse to speak to him until he becomes a soldier.  Months pass, and Johnny, sad and alone, is piloting his train  the General  when it is stolen from him by the North.  Johnny's efforts to recover the General  and to win back his girl's love  become an unbelievably funny and action-packed series of events, as Johnny tries to go from being a sad-sack buffoon to being a hero.If you haven't watched many silent films, they demand a greater amount of attention than `normal' film  there are no audio cues; and volumes can be spoken with a simple facial expression.  Buster Keaton is amazingly expressive, as he's fully capable of going from wildly happy to downtrodden and sad in the blink of an eye.  While funny, Keaton is much more than just a clownish figure  he manages to evoke a lot of sympathy as well, and he genuinely becomes what can only be described as an action hero as well.  His timing, whether for a joke or for a tender moment, is absolutely impeccable.What's also great about `The General' is the sheer amount of stunts and physical humor  a movie like this couldn't be made today.  No amount of insurance would cover it.  Keaton does all his own stunts, and manages to perform a number of feats that are simultaneously hilarious and dangerous  he chases down `The General' with a bike, he sits on a moving cattlecatcher, knocking away railroad ties with a tie of his own.  All these stunts are fantastic, but it's scary to think that any one of these probably could've killed Keaton if something even went slightly wrong.  
`The General' is a lot more than slapstick.  Personally, I think it's one of the first films to push the envelope of movies  it goes for action, romance, and humor, and it pulls all of those elements together into a terrific movie. If you've never seen Buster Keaton  or, for that matter, a silent film  go find this one and watch it.  It's a classic.

The Guns of Navarone (1961) - IMDb,"For any boy growing up when I did, back in the late 1970s, it was well understood that ""Guns of Navarone"" was the sine qua non of adventure films, a movie you called friends about when you saw it listed in next week's TV Guide. It's hard to believe so much time has gone by, both since my boyhood and since the film was made, but ""Navarone"" still holds up very well, a character-driven film alive with nuance and subtlety. It moves at an assured clip, not rushed or forced, making the viewer follow its story through every agonizing twist and turn.What makes the film especially good is the crisp dialogue, lines that point up the moral and philosophical argument at the heart of the film and which resonate today as much as then:Mallory: The only way to win a war is to be just as nasty as the enemy. The one thing that worries me is we're liable to wake up one morning, and find we're even nastier than they are.Franklin: I can't say that worries me!Mallory: Well, you're lucky.Good performances abound, but the best by far is David Niven's Cpl. Miller, a complex character whose smooth front and witty banter conceals much of the conflict of the film. It's he who tangles most often with Gregory Peck's Mallory, and has at least three scenes in the film that are top-rate. We may like Miller because he keeps things humming and provides welcome comic relief, but he's no less the center of the film than Peck or Anthony Quinn, the two well-cast leads whose relationship is enriched, at least from our remove, by the unique vow Stavros has made to Mallory about the unsettled business between them.The plot is a thing of beauty, moving with all the synchronicity and clever precision of a diabolical cuckoo clock. The special effects have suffered more than a bit from the march of time (though one should remember that was the only part of the film that won an Oscar in 1962). Some process shots are cringe-inducing now. But the pace is still gripping and the payoff spectacular. Here's the film that was the template to every popcorn actioner that came after, its imprint recognizable on everything from the James Bond movies to ""Star Wars"" to Indiana Jones. That's impressive, but more so is that ""Guns"" remains as entertaining as any one of them, and more thrilling than most.",Bill,Slocum5/August,8, Every bit as good as you remembered...,1,"[boy, grow, back, late, well, understood, gun, navarone, sine, qua, non, adventure, film, movie, call, friend, saw, list, next, week, tv, guide, hard, believe, much, time, go, since, boyhood, since, film, make, navarone, still, hold, well, film, alive, nuance, subtlety, move, assure, clip, rush, force, make, viewer, follow, story, every, agonize, twist, make, film, especially, good, crisp, dialogue, line, point, moral, philosophical, argument, heart, film, resonate, today, much, mallory, way, win, war, nasty, enemy, one, thing, worry, liable, wake, one, morning, find, even, nastier, say, worry, mallory, well, performance, abound, best, far, david, niven, cpl, miller, complex, character, whose, smooth, ...]","[for, any boy, growing, up, when, i, did, back, in, the late 1970s, it, was well understood, that, guns, of, navarone, was, of, adventure films, a movie you, called, friends, about, when, you, saw, it, listed, in, next week, tv guide, it, is, hard, to, believe, so much time, has gone, by, both since my boyhood, since, the film, was made, navarone, still holds, up, very well, a character-driven film, alive, with, nuance and subtlety, it, moves, at, assured, clip, not rushed, forced, making, the viewer follow its story, through, every agonizing twist, turn.what, makes, the film, especially, good, is, the crisp dialogue, lines, that, point, up, moral and, philosophical argument, at, the heart, of, the film, which resonate today, as much, as, then:mallory, the only way, to, win, a war, is, to, be, just as nasty, as, the enemy, the one thing, that, worries me, is, we, are, liable, ...]",35.85322893750685,-13.265032433523144,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,1,2,0,2,0,2,5.672727272727273,165,203,boy growing late 1970s well understood guns navarone sine qua non adventure films movie called friends saw listed next weeks tv guide hard believe much time gone since boyhood since film made navarone still holds well character driven film alive nuance subtlety moves assured clip rushed forced making viewer follow story every agonizing twist turn makes film especially good crisp dialogue lines point moral philosophical argument heart film resonate today much mallory way win war nasty enemy thing worries liable wake morning even nastier franklin worries mallory well lucky good performances abound best far david nivens cpl miller complex character whose smooth front witty banter conceals much conflict film tangles often gregory pecks mallory least scenes film top rate may like miller keeps things humming provides welcome comic relief less center film peck anthony quinn well cast leads whose relationship enriched least remove unique vow stavros made mallory unsettled business plot thing beauty moving synchronicity clever precision diabolical cuckoo clock special effects suffered bit march time though remember part film oscar 1962 process shots cringe inducing pace still gripping payoff spectacular heres film template every popcorn actioner came imprint recognizable everything james bond movies star wars indiana jones impressive guns remains entertaining thrilling,0.21510025062656643,0.543765664160401,1
The Hunt for Red October (1990) - IMDb,"'Red October' did for modern submarine warfare what 'Das Boot' did for WWII. It took a concept that is inconceivable to most people (living in a boat underwater with people trying to blow you up) and brought it up close and personal.  The resulting suspense and excitement for this type of film is always extremely entertaining and this film delivers nicely.Tom Clancy's thrilling novel converts well to the big screen.  Clancy is a master of making improbable tales of international intrigue seem plausible. This story of a Soviet sub commander who is trying to defect to the U.S. adds a unique twist to the suspense normally associated with submarine films.John McTiernan, who is building an enormous reputation in the action/adventure genre did a fabulous job as director.  This film focused less on the submarine and its crew than its cousin 'Das Boot', and more on the international intrigue angle.  McTiernan is very effective in keeping up the pace and giving the viewer riveting suspense as smart torpedos chase subs through the murky deep.As always, Sean Connery was powerful as the defecting captain, determined not to allow this first strike weapon to start a nuclear holocaust.  Connery gave his character both a conscience and a ruthless commitment, stopping at nothing to reach his goal.Alec Baldwin turns in one of his better performances as Jack Ryan.  Unlike Harrison Ford who made Ryan into an action hero in other Tom Clancy adaptations, Baldwin seemed better cast as the CIA nerd who was thrust into a field situation without any real experience.  In this way, I felt he was a better representation of the character as Clancy originally wrote him.This is a highly entertaining and engrossing film that will keep most action and suspense viewers on the edge of their seats.

The Hunt for Red October (1990) - IMDb,"I can't believe that there is only one negative comment for this film. Anyone with a deeper knowledge of the subject will point out to you that the movie is greatly flawed, and at times hilarious at its portrayal of Russians. For example, singing the soviet national anthem on a sub is pure Hollywood. The political officer is not the second in command. The crew would not be so quick to cooperate with the captain. Plus if you knew some real history you'd know that something like this happened in 1975 only with a ship, and the captain wound up being shot by a firing squad. The guy wishing to live in Montana is simply ridiculous. Next we get the numerous technical problems, like there is no way a sub could do a turn in several seconds. Have you any idea how big these things are? It would take several seconds just to start its propellers rolling. I won't even get into the ""caterpillar"" drive's ridiculousness. Lets just say that even if it did exist it would not be any quieter then a propeller. Finally for a movie that seems to aim for accuracy, the Russian pronunciations in it are simply horrible. I know it might not matter much to most of you, but they should have at least tried to make it believable. This could go on forever, but I'll spare you.

The Hurricane Heist (2018) - IMDb,"This is the perfect genre film of 2018 I believe. Rob Cohen made this morally recommended real disaster master piece. Any bad disaster film is just to show disaster game which does not focus on conflicts among human protagonist and antagonists.
 This category 5 hurricane is just a narrative device like zombies in George Romero's Dead series. True disaster film tells human conflicts under disaster not the monster-like disastrous phenomena itself.
 We can say shark is not the antagonist of JAWS (1975) but the mayer and the entourage are the true antagonists in the human conflict. This is the correct point of view in terms of story telling. 
 The Hurricane Heist mainly describes the heist related conflict among the U.S. Treasury officers and corrupted local police men during category 5 hurricane mess. Main drama is the Die Hard-like heist incident not the monster hurricane. 
 I can say that Armageddon(1998), Deep Impact (1998), Twister (1996) are just disaster games rather than serious human conflicts. This hurricane is equal with fictional function of any monsters in filmmaking. All of them are not antagonists but are devices to express human conflicts among human characters. Any defect of humanity is lack of true drama. The Hurricane Heist makes us realise what true antagonist should be. 
 Besides this important structural achievement, we also can not ignore clear cinematic refrain among tight sequences in the end of Act 2 to Act 3 which are chase scenes from the federal bank to the highway with category 5 hurricane threatens them from their behind. 
 The corrupted policemen and Perkins' decision to betray their duty, Will and Casey's decision to be loyal to their duty are perfectly and consciously contrasted in the story structure. Decision making is the nature of plot and it embodies meaning of subtext in the entire cinematic expressions. 
 Moreover, this decision making is finally refrained after the escape from the hurricane. The protagonists, Will and Casey don't make a kind of decision to steal the federal bank money when they can do it like the failed villains. This is the structure. The screen writer highly conscious about the plotting that express meaning of entire context clearly. 
 
 
I was really impressed with this quality work among other genre films in 2018! US film is the best of the bests!

The Incredibles (2004) - IMDb,"Shortly after Dreamworks screwed up with the uninspired ""Shark Tale"", Pixar contains its remarkably success story with ""The Incredibles"". And while I have to say that I liked ""Finding Nemo"" a bit better, ""The Incredibles"" is still an amazing movie.First of all, this is because it's funny. It's not so funny that you're constantly laughing out loud, but there are more than enough good jokes in the movie to keep you entertained, and it's full of good observations about superhero movies (note all the ridiculous superhero and villain names) and references to other movies. It's also a brilliant James Bond spoof/homage, containing all the gadgets, secret island bases and crazy schemes that made early Bond movies so much fun.Secondly, this movie has heart and charm in droves. It's full of memorably and likable characters you can really identify with and care about. Characters like Edna are instant classics. The voice acting is universally excellent, but Holly Hunter steals the show as Elastigirl. This is a movie that doesn't need toilet humor, characters modeled like celebrities, or a ""hip"" soundtrack...it easily succeeds on charm and style alone.Also, I found it to be a surprisingly good action movie. The plentiful action sequences are full of energy, extremely fast-paced, and exciting, and put many a live-action movie to shame.Finally, I also liked the tone and message of the movie. ""The Incredibles"" basically makes a plea against mediocrity, breaking with the politically correct idea that ""everybody is special"" (and thus nobody really is), and encouraging people to use the talents they have been given. I think this couldn't be more true. Not all people are equally talented (just compare Pixar to Dreamworks), but this is no reason to keep the talented people from not reaching their full potential just because it makes the less talented ones feel bad.""The Incredibles"", while maybe not as hilarious as I had hoped (though it's still very funny), is nonetheless an extremely entertaining movie, that manages to charm you wit its combination of great characters, lots of style, tongue-in-cheek attitude and good message.

The Incredibles (2004) - IMDb,"Movies don't just entertain -- they MEAN. They have messages. They instruct, influence, and evoke.So what is the meaning of _The_Incredibles_? Simple: You Don't Count.I am, perhaps, unusual in that I scrutinize every movie, TV show, newspaper story and advertisement for its deeper message -- but I think that practice is a lot more common when we consider media aimed at children, as this movie, with its toy tie-ins and McDonalds-driven marketing, most certainly is. So when friends suggested that Pixar had hit another one out of the park with _The_Incredibles_, I naturally screened it for my kid, thinking this would be a beauty.Imagine my shock and dismay to find that, underneath the comic-book overtones, this is not a movie for kids at all. Not only is the violence fast, furious, and rampant, it's deadly...as the characters themselves point out, Saturday Morning Cartoons offer kids an unrealistic belief that deadly violence is somehow fun. Well OK, I can get behind that message, but it's going to be tricky explaining to my six-year-old that when he sees a plane full of bad-guys blow up as it rips through a tree, that this isn't just metaphorical -- that guy is DEAD.But I got more and more disturbed when I saw that the majority of the violence in this movie wasn't being perpetrated by the bad guys at all -- it's mostly coming from our ""heroes,"" The Incredible family themselves. Mr. I. uproots trees, tosses bombs, knocks down buildings, and punches mere mortal villains with fists which we've seen lift train cars. And then, in a fit of pique, in an early establishing scene, Mr. Incredible punches his boss. Who is *NOT* a villain. He's an unarmed civilian, which Mr. Incredible outweighs by about 200 pounds. He punches this guy through several walls, and later views of this poor guy in the hospital make it clear that he's broken a lot of bones.This is our HERO???? And then there's the main message of the film: you don't count. You see you, me, all us non-super-heroes, we aren't ""special,"" like the Incredibles. And no, the idea that everyone has some special quality, that everyone has unique skills or traits, that's disdained by our hero as a ""celebration of mediocrity"" -- his normal job, like the one you and I have, you see that's not good enough for the special people. No, the special people should be given the opportunity to requisition government aircraft, to own supercars they haven't paid for, to throw civilians through walls without any consequence if they act annoying. In fact, the guy who suggests that everyone *could* be special or super, if given the chance, is the VILLAIN of the movie! So there goes about 2,000 years worth of morality, right down the drain. According to this movie, might makes right, and anyone who thinks otherwise deserves to be stomped into the pavement.

The Iron Giant (1999) - IMDb,"I'm 25 years old.  I have no children.  So why am I praising a 'kid's movie' which nobody saw?  Because I have never seen a film pack the emotional wallop 'The Iron Giant' provided.The film's plot is similar to 'E.T.' - a young boy meets an alien robot from outer space, who is stranded on earth, and runs afoul of paranoid government agents.  Not to knock the Spielberg film, but what makes 'The Iron Giant' the better film is that the young boy is the teacher.  It is he who has to teach the Giant about the beauty of life, the difference between good and evil, and choices we have to make.  The Iron Giant, it turns out, is a weapon, who has to struggle against his own nature.  The film has an obvious (and timely) gun control message, but its real message is about the choice we make when dealing with other people.  We can use our powers for good or lash out at everyone around us.I dare not give away the climax.  All I will say is that it features a sacrifice absolutely breaktaking and emotionally shattering (albeit somewhat blunted by the ending).  The animation is gorgeous, Michael Kamen's score is perfect, and the film beautifully evokes the 1950s.Sadly, poor marketing kept audiences away in droves.  All I can say is, to heck with the box office gross.  Despite Warner's appearant desire to pretend the film never existed, the word is getting around about what a magical film this is, and I have no doubt it will join 'It's a Wonderful Life' as a film which bombed in theatres but became a classic over the years.

The Karate Kid Part III (1989) - IMDb,"What is Daniel Larusso's problem? Why after three torturous films is he no more a man than when he first moved to L.A? I just don't get it!! In the first installment he had an excuse to be a sissy; he was being bullied by the bad boys of his new school and he didn't know how to defend himself. I accept that! In the second one, he was in a foreign land and was being bullied by some oriental bad-boy. He gets his butt kicked throughout until the last scene when in the face of near death, he looks into Miyagi's eyes and gets the inspiration to overcome fear and win the day and the girl. I don't buy it but I can bear it!! In the third installment, he projects so much obnoxiousness and pathetic emotion that you hope that his clearly, superior opponents will kick his ass once and for all. No such luck!!
In this film Daniel is forced to defend his title which requires him to fight only the final match.(Easy enough no?) His opponent is some blonde punk who is being trained by Kreese (the disgraced teacher in the first film whose nose Miyagi twists to render him unconscious)and backed by the finances of Terry Silver, a smooth Karate kicking business man. Silver, played with nice slick touches by Thomas Ian Griffith is watchable as he disrupts Daniel's level of discipline and successfully convinces Daniel that he wants to help him defend his title after Miyagi refuses. Daniel, idiot that he is, can't see the charade and accepts his help. Griffith projects some air of smoothness but doesn't quite convince he's really all that cool. Still some Karate student that I know,  Amir Hashim-Zada seems to think he epitomizes 21st Century Maleness. To each his own, I guess! The three of them have a business deal going that requires Daniel to fight the final and get beaten in order for their new Dojo's to be opened. Miyagi refuses to train Daniel because he feels Daniel's reasons for defense are wrong. Please excuse Daniel for getting beaten up throughout the film and being forced to enter the tournament!!. Sorry Miyagi, how unreasonable Daniel has become!!! Anyway enough plot....What I don't get is why Daniel complains and cries consistently about his circumstances and seems to have forgotten any skills that Miyagi has taught him over the past couple of films. That is until, in the heat of the moment, he looks into Miyagi's eyes and everything comes back!!(How realistic!!). I loved the first film, for although Daniel was predictably annoying, he was living out the zero to hero story we all love. And Miyagi became a household name that we couldn't not love. Incidentally, Miyagi remains good throughout the films. Without him the movie hasn't a leg to stand on. It's a real statement on the charisma of the leading man Macchio. He simply has none.
The trouble with Daniel is that he has the weakest personality that doesn't ever appear to develop, despite all Miyagi's wisdom, until the last 2 minutes of the film. I can accept that these films don't expect that much from the viewer, but come on!!, we should at least believe that Daniel is a worthy hero by the end. I find it really funny that Miyagi likens Daniel's spirit to that of a bonsai tree with a strong root. Daniel seems to make Miyagi's wisdom and teachings look meaningless. Daniel ought to be a man's man by this film, but he still walks like a girl, he talks like a girl, and BY GOD he still FIGHTS like a girl!!!Any sympathy you may have mustered for him from the past two films is quickly dispensed in this film because he whines and cries when things consistently don't go his way. For God's Sake Daniel, are you that dense, since when do things go your way??? By now you should be man enough to deal with the bad things in life!!!! Everyone else does and most haven't had the privilege of Miyagi's teachings!!
I must say the final scene is truly pathetic!!The bad boy is keen to win a point then lose a point thereby keeping the scores at 0-0. He wants Daniel to suffer (Don't we all?) so he claims a legitimate point then beats the life out of him to lose the point. The match makes it abundantly clear that Daniel is 5 belts worse than this guy. BUT the match tied at 0-0 thanks entirely to the bad-boy, goes into sudden death when Daniel searches deep inside of himself, giving the obligatory look to Miyagi, and pulls off one good move and wins the match. Then he has the arrogance to say ""Yes We did It"" as if he should have the audacity to think he deserved to win the fight. It could be poor writing or bad acting, or both, but it's a pity that even after 3 films, even my young girl cousin reckons she could beat up whimpy Daniel!! The irony of all of this, is that this film is shamefully watchable. I like it because Daniel forces giggles from the audience and Miyagi is always watchable as he chants his pearls of wisdom and does his various spiritual mantra's that are meant to mean something!! Sorry Miyagi, I didn't quite catch their significance this time around, and as much as I like you, I fear Daniel has not learned a bleeding thing from you since you met

Daniel was physically outmatched (yeah, I know, he always is), but it was just nice to see something good come out of all of this. And seeing him outsmart the other guy was kinda nice. But there's a dour tone to this entire movie, and it all seems a bit silly. Alright, so Kreese has bottomed out, and he's looking to rise from the muck and destroy Daniel LaRusso. That's kinda by-the-numbers for a second sequel, but I can see how they'd go with this for the hook. But the plan is to put the kid through psychological torment and macho head games to finally break his spirit and put the hurt on him. And it's all at the behest of the always-leering Terry Silver. They're just such one-dimensional bad guys. Pitting Daniel against Miyagi didn't make much sense because it could've all been handled with some rational explaining (but Daniel this time around is more hotheaded than ever). Pat Morita makes this all sorta worthwhile because he well wears the weariness of a character that loses so much in the story. But I was surprised at how unsympathetic LaRusso was in this movie, and it's not very well-written. I've gotta wonder how this movie is different from Kamen's original script because it all feels very off. It's not a bad movie, just . . . silly. 5/10",Mr-Fusion23,September/2014,5," It's kinda like the first two movies, just without the heart and decent characters",0,"[get, say, surprise, end, karate, kid, part, iii, daniel, physically, outmatch, yeah, know, always, nice, see, something, good, come, see, outsmart, guy, kinda, nice, dour, tone, entire, movie, seems, bit, silly, alright, kreese, bottom, look, rise, muck, destroy, daniel, larusso, kinda, second, sequel, see, would, go, hook, plan, put, kid, psychological, torment, macho, head, game, finally, break, spirit, put, hurt, behest, terry, silver, bad, guy, pit, daniel, miyagi, make, much, sense, could, handle, rational, explain, daniel, time, around, hotheaded, ever, pat, morita, make, sorta, worthwhile, well, wear, weariness, character, loses, much, story, surprised, unsympathetic, larusso, movie, get, wonder, movie, different, ...]","[i, have got, to, say, i, was surprised, by, ending, to, the karate kid part iii, daniel, was physically outmatched, i know, he, always is, it, was, just nice, to, see, something good come, out of, all of, seeing, him, outsmart, the other guy, was, kinda nice, is, a dour tone, to, this entire movie, it, seems, a bit, silly, alright, so, kreese, has bottomed, out, he, is looking, to, rise, from, the muck, destroy, daniel larusso, is, kinda by-the-numbers, for, a second sequel, i, can see, how, they, would go, with, this for, the hook, the plan, is, to, put, the kid, through, psychological torment, macho head games, to, finally break, his spirit, put, the hurt, on, him, it, is, all at, the behest, of, the always-leering terry silver, they, are, just such one-dimensional bad guys, pitting, daniel, against, miyagi, did not make, much sense, because, it, could have, been handled, with, some rational explaining, daniel, this time, ...]",-81.60541772294009,-1.2853316301344402,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,3,2,4,4,2,0,0,4,4,5,5.483516483516484,91,111,got ta surprised ending karate kid part iii daniel physically outmatched yeah know always nice something good seeing outsmart guy kinda nice dour tone entire movie seems bit silly alright kreese bottomed looking rise muck destroy daniel larusso kinda numbers second sequel would hook plan put kid psychological torment macho head games finally break spirit put hurt behest always leering terry silver dimensional bad guys pitting daniel miyagi much sense could handled rational explaining daniel time around hotheaded ever pat morita makes sorta worthwhile well wears weariness character loses much story surprised unsympathetic larusso movie well written got ta wonder movie different kamens original script feels bad movie silly 5 10,0.02261904761904764,0.5571995464852607,1
The Killer (1989) - IMDb,"The Killer (1989) is in my opinion John Woo's masterpiece and one of the best classic action films from Hong Kong I have ever seen. It is one of my personal favorite John Woo action movies. This film has everything, it has even a sad ending, which neither one action movie has that kind of ending. Chow Yun-Fat gave us one of his best performances ever, Danny Lee was outstanding as Hong Kong Police officer. The action, the gore, the violence, the gun play everything is in this movie. The final showdown in the church was one the best action scenes ever made in a film. 
It is my fifth favorite John Woo film! The first four will be Hard Target (1993), Hard Boiled (1992), Broken Arrow (1996) and Paycheck (2003) this is the fifth John Woo favorite action film of mine that I love to death. Chow Yun-Fat's character Ah Jong was well written and well done, but it isn't close as is his character Insp. 'Tequila' Yuen from Hard Boiled. This is was the first film with John Woo as I have saw when I was 10. years old, I think I was 12 or 13 when I first time saw Hard Boiled, but still I had no Idea both of the movies are from same director with the same actor. I love this movie to death and it is one of my favorite action movies.Plot: Chow Yun-Fat stars as an expert assassin who finds himself conflicted with his work in his one last hit in hopes of using his earnings to restore vision to a singer he accidentally blinded, only to be double-crossed by his boss. Danny Lee co-stars as the Hong Kong Police Force inspector determined to catch the assassin and take down the organization that employs him. These two guys from the opposite worlds end up becoming friends and working together to bring down their bigger enemy.The Killer gained numerous international accolades for Woo and its influence can be seen in countless action films in the following decades including in the movies directed by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. The action is, as always with a John Woo movie, spectacular but the characters are well developed and the story is very engaging. It's not quite as big in scale as Hard Boiled but it's still very well paced with plenty of great action. What is it about Hit men in movies that they are always so damn cool? Like Hard Boiled, the music is pretty cheap and forgettable sounding but it doesn't detract from the action. We get the doves, the slow-mo and the religious imagery aplenty in this film and as with Hard Boiled there is little to find fault with.I still love Hard Boiled better than The Killer because Hard Boiled has happy ending and The Killer has not a happy ending, but still I love this movie and it is an action Classic and John Woo directing this movie did the best job ever as been the director and a writer the same time. This man John Woo is outstanding and the actors are just amazing, the characters are well written and the chemistry between Chow Yun-fat and Danny Lee is well written and are making a great due as the opposite team. You know Sylvester Stallone, Sung Kang and Walter Hill should all take a school of action movies from John Woo's The Killer, because those three American guys sucked at making an action film in 2012 Bullet to the Head failed and it sucked ass. Sylvester Stallone and Sung Kang as a hired hit-man and a police detective had no written chemistry working together and they both suck! Chow Yun-Fat and Danny Lee are the real team as hired professional hit-man and a Hong Kong police officer. Those two guys are the real team, I will rather watch this movie than Walter Hill's Bullet to the Head! This movie it is a perfect 10, it takes the vision of one of the most creative intelligent action directors in HK cinema eve! The film is filled the most explosive showdowns in cinematic history. It is loaded with some with the most outrageously choreographed action sequences ever committed to film and an absolute hailstorm of bullets. It is fast paced, better more choreographed stylized action. The Killer is a perfect action film as one could ask for.Overall: I think The Killer is on par with Hard Boiled but there's maybe a little more focus on the story than action....but the action in that delivers too. A pair with Hard Boiled is a it's truly bad ass. My favorite action movie with Hard Target and Hard Boiled! I love them to death it get's a perfect 10!",ivo-cobra818,January/2016,10, John Woo's masterpiece one of his best HK classics action films ever!,1,"[killer, opinion, john, woo, masterpiece, one, best, classic, action, film, hong, kong, ever, see, one, personal, favorite, john, woo, action, movie, film, everything, even, sad, end, neither, one, action, movie, kind, end, chow, give, us, one, best, performance, ever, danny, lee, outstanding, hong, kong, police, officer, action, gore, violence, gun, play, everything, movie, final, showdown, church, one, best, action, scene, ever, make, film, fifth, favorite, john, woo, film, first, four, hard, target, hard, boil, broken, arrow, paycheck, fifth, john, woo, favorite, action, film, mine, love, death, chow, character, ah, jong, well, write, well, do, close, character, insp, yuen, hard, boil, ...]","[the killer, is, in, my opinion john woo, masterpiece, of, the best classic action films, from, hong kong i, have ever seen, it, is, of, my personal favorite john woo action movies, this film, has, everything, it, has, even, a sad ending, which neither one action movie, has, that, kind, of, ending, chow yun-fat, gave, us, of, his best performances, ever, danny lee, was, outstanding, as, hong kong police officer, the action, gore, the violence, the gun play everything, is, in, this movie, the final showdown, in, the church, was, one the best action scenes, ever made, in, a film, it, is, my fifth favorite john woo film, first, will be, hard target, hard boiled, broken, arrow, paycheck, is, the fifth john woo, favorite action film, of, mine, that, i love, to, death, chow yun-fat, character, jong, was well written, well done, it, is not close, is, his character insp, tequila, yuen, from, hard boiled, is was, the first film, with, john woo, as, i, have saw, when, i, was, years, old, i, think i was, when, ...]",259.85187821261866,67.75699096059303,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,1,2,1,4,2,3,1,4,1,2,0,5.5799086757990874,219,435,killer 1989 opinion john woos masterpiece best classic action films hong kong ever seen personal favorite john woo action movies film everything even sad ending neither action movie kind ending chow yun fat gave us best performances ever danny lee outstanding hong kong police officer action gore violence gun play everything movie final showdown church best action scenes ever made film fifth favorite john woo film first hard target 1993 hard boiled 1992 broken arrow 1996 paycheck 2003 fifth john woo favorite action film mine love death chow yun fats character ah jong well written well done close character insp tequila yuen hard boiled first film john woo saw 10 years old think 12 13 first time saw hard boiled still idea movies director actor love movie death favorite action movies plot chow yun fat stars expert assassin finds conflicted work last hit hopes using earnings restore vision singer accidentally blinded double crossed boss danny lee co stars hong kong police force inspector determined catch assassin take organization employs guys opposite worlds end becoming friends working together bring bigger enemy killer gained numerous international accolades woo influence seen countless action films following decades including movies directed quentin tarantino robert rodriguez action always john woo movie spectacular characters well developed story engaging quite big scale hard boiled still well paced plenty great action hit men movies always damn cool like hard boiled music pretty cheap forgettable sounding detract action doves slow mo religious imagery aplenty film hard boiled little fault still love hard boiled better killer hard boiled happy ending killer happy ending still love movie action classic john woo directing movie best job ever director writer time man john woo outstanding actors amazing characters well written chemistry chow yun fat danny lee well written making great due opposite team know sylvester stallone sung kang walter hill take school action movies john woos killer american guys sucked making action film 2012 bullet head failed sucked ass sylvester stallone sung kang hired hit man police detective written chemistry working together suck chow yun fat danny lee real team hired professional hit man hong kong police officer guys real team rather watch movie walter hills bullet head movie perfect 10 takes vision creative intelligent action directors hk cinema eve film filled explosive showdowns cinematic history loaded outrageously choreographed action sequences ever committed film absolute hailstorm bullets fast paced better choreographed stylized action killer perfect action film could overall think killer par hard boiled maybe little focus story action action delivers pair hard boiled truly bad ass favorite action movie hard target hard boiled love death gets perfect 10,0.17260802469135803,0.4646604938271605,1
The Last Airbender (2010) - IMDb,"I would like to share my son's review. He just turned 8 and dictated as his dad typed: I just hate it so bad!!!I'm a HUGE fan of the the cartoons. I have the whole series, including Water, Earth and Fire. It was a HUGE disappointment because even by the time I saw the commercial, I knew it would be completely crushing! I mean, the characters! Iroh was the greatest disappointment. He was not kind and wise enough. And also he was not old enough. And why can't they say anyone's name right!???I thought it was completely disrespectful to put the characters skin colors the opposite. After the first twenty minutes of it I was bored already but I have to say the effects were decent. And the Avatar did not have enough happiness in him! I think it's important to the movie. Aang is the main character of the movie, and he should at least get a little more happiness inside of him! When I got home that night I had to watch the cartoon series for some time to completely forget about the movie! And... actually, I'm watching it right now! If anybody wanted to see this movie I would suggest they close their eyes and ears!!!*********************Dad's two cents:My son became interested in Avatar the Last Air Bender, the animated series at age 4.I bought him the entire series on DVD as soon as the episodes were available and he and I devoured every episode, again and again. Compared to the magnificently crafted animated series, I'd have to say the live action movie was an abysmal embarrassment, a sophomoric and vapid display of ignorance. Go rent or buy the animated series instead. I think it's some of the best fiction ever written for children. It's incredible. It's an epic parable dealing with sophisticated philosophical, cultural, emotional and spiritual issues which have plagued human civilization since the emergence of reason. And it does it with lightheartedness and joy. The theme deals with no less than issues of greed, power, spirituality, and the formation of identity and moral values. It grapples with the ideals of pacifism. It teaches teamwork, compassion, empathy and humility. It exemplifies wisdom and the appreciation of art, nature and connectedness - connectedness to each other, to nature, to animals, to the universe, and emphasizes detachment from possession. The story line traverses goofy playfulness, tween and young teen crushes and love, family power dynamics, friendship, mental illness, and gut wrenching loss. And it's an incredible primer for Eastern spiritual ideals and mythology. But these things can't be achieved effectively without superb craftsmanship. So beautifully wrought is this story that the fun, action and struggles are adeptly punctuated with moving poignancy. The live action version is NONE of these things. No insight, no depth of character, only the most cursory references of some of the core thematic values of the animated series, and those done so poorly as to come off as just... pathetically trite. The thing I find most upsetting regarding the failure of this movie to deliver is that the original animated series covers all of what I find to be the best of Eastern culture, and we Westerners need to understand these things in this global community. Buddhist and Confucian ideals and philosophies are front and center and, in my mind, are the greatest gifts the East has to offer the world, and the very things that are most clearly in danger of vanishing in the face of the West's insignificant obsession with material gain and conspicuous consumption.And another thing, too. It's typical that this story was handled on the level it was - dismissively. Adults appear to be largely disinterested in the profound turmoil in which children are engaged as they enter their teens. They are forming their value systems, they are trying to reconcile reality with fantasy and desire. They are trying to find the balance between selfishness and empathy. They are finding what it means to be themselves, members of a community, and a species on the planet. They are in agony grappling with issues we were happy to leave behind. But these struggles are never truly resolved, and our ideas of who we are and how we fit in the world cannot remain fixed, and, yet, when they are challenged, we adults consider ourselves to be in a state of crisis, when that is the perpetual state of being of a young teen. And I would argue it's a state of flux that we should never leave, that we should always be questioning ourselves, our figures of authority, and our place in the world and in relation to those around us. I do not see these struggles as juvenile, but human, and the animated series brings all these struggles to mind. Sadly, the movie did little to bring the richness of these struggles to life. In my most critical mood, I would say this failure is deeply offensive to my sensibilities as a human being.But on the other hand, not everyone has the depth of vision and creative genius to pull off what admittedly would be a very challenging feat. I just wish I could see what David Lean could have done with this story.",mckee-783-6211926,July/2010,1, An 8 year old's assessment,0,"[would, like, share, son, review, turn, dictate, dad, typed,

The Last Samurai (2003) - IMDb,"After my third viewing, I can finally admit that this film has me. I enjoyed it during its theatrical run, enjoyed it more the second time around, and now, I can only say that I love it. The cast is exemplary. Tom Cruise is so good in this film that it is very often easy to forget he is Tom Cruise. Easily his most powerful role and best performance since Jerry Maguire. Ken Watanabe, however, is incredible in every scene - acting with a rare sensitivity and intensity and breathing life into a character much larger and more human than the grand story of which he is a part. Though the entire cast is excellent, I feel that I must also single out Koyuki and Shichinosuke Nakamura for, respectively, the female lead and the emperor, for the subtle strength and believability they each give their very challenging roles.The story takes place during the early modernization of Japan, in the 1870s and 1880s. The Emperor's power has been weakened by the political and economic power of his cabinet, by his young age, and by the political influence of the United States and other western powers pulling the strings of his cabinet and supplying modern weaponry and tactics to the modernizing Japanese army. Cruise plays Captain Allgren, an alcoholic veteran who has seen and participated in too many massacres of innocent people, and is offered an opportunity to reclaim some of his honor by helping to train the Japanese military in the use of firearms. When he arrives in Japan, we learn that the first test of the Japanese army and its new weapons will be against a rebellious group of samurai who believe themselves to be in the service of the Emperor and Japan, but resist the Emperor's cabinet and the influence of western nations. In the power void left by a passive emperor, Japan seems poised to enter into a civil war against its own values, faith and honor. During the first attack on the Samurai, Allgren is captured by the Samurai and begins a spiritual, physical and philosophical journey which will bring him a level of self-respect his own culture could never supply.My interpretation of this journey is that Allgren has found a place and people that offer him redemption, where, in his own world, he can find none. But Allgren's is only a small part of the story - which ultimately revolves around what is right for Japan, for the subjectivity of a whole nation, and how to portray such a subject from its own perspective. Traditional Japan is treated with empathy here, not aggrandizing exaggeration, as some of the film's critics seem to suggest. This is not a film about what is objectively right and wrong, but a film about struggling to understand and empower tradition as a means to control and benefit from change. I find no grand moral statement here, but rather an intense, sympathetic, human drama with a strong sense of honor and sacrifice.Edward Zwick has made a film which operates well at every level, carrying simple but profound philosophical ideas, but avoiding the mistake of making these ideas and the characters that express them super-heroic. Ultimately, this beautifully shot film conveys powerful messages about war, tradition, ethics, honor and culture, which, though not particularly original, are sensitively and intelligently brought forward. There is a lot of action, including some remarkably well-acted sword fighting and martial artistry, but none of it seems unnecessary and the whole film is truly tightly woven.

The Last of the Mohicans (1992) - IMDb,"""The Last of the Mohicans"" was one of the most popular and acclaimed films of 1992. Its vision of early America, as it was during the French and Indian War, is captured in its utter brutality and beauty, complete with the many driving ambitions and clashing cultures of everyone involved.This movie has a bit of everything, including action, romance, war, and passionate drama. The director, Michael Mann, knows the story well and does all but completely discard James Fenimore Cooper's source material, which some have dubbed as being racist and totally unfair in its portrait of Native Americans.The story (and what a story) is all over the place, with three frontier scouts - Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), Chingachgook (Russell Means), and Uncas (Eric Schweig) - escorting a British colonel's daughters - Cora and Alice Munro (Madeleine Stowe and Jodhi May respectively) - to safety at the besieged Fort William Henry. Major Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) rivals Hawkeye for Cora's affections and a vengeance-driven Huron named Magua (Wes Studi) seeks to have both daughters killed in retribution for the loss of his own children.This is by far Mann's best film yet (it ranks #15 on my all-time favorite movies list) and he uses the lush wilderness settings to great effect. He also makes good use of the editing, which actually comes in handy when showcasing the brutal violence that dominates much of the film's action sequences. The film's last 20 minutes are a definite stunner that can only be described as classic and vicious.This is a great movie that shows America in its infancy, complete with the rivalries, intrigue, and violence that I'm sure was an everyday part of life during this hectic time period.10/10",dee.reid19,November/2004,10," Fierce, bold, and beautiful - ""The Last of the Mohicans""",1,"[last, mohican, one, popular, acclaim, film, vision, early, america, french, indian, war, capture, utter, brutality, beauty, complete, many, drive, ambition, clash, culture, everyone, movie, bit, everything, include, action, romance, war, passionate, drama, director, michael, mann, know, story, well, completely, discard, james, fenimore, cooper, source, material, dubbed, racist, totally, unfair, portrait, native, story, story, place, three, frontier, scout, hawkeye, daniel, chingachgook, russell, mean, uncas, eric, schweig, escort, british, colonel, daughter, cora, alice, munro, madeleine, stowe, jodhi, may, respectively, safety, besiege, fort, william, henry, major, duncan, heyward, steven, waddington, rival, hawkeye, cora, affection, huron, name, magua, wes, studi, seek, daughter, kill, retribution, ...]","[the last, of, the mohicans, was, of, most popular, acclaimed, films, of, its vision, of, early america, as, it, was, during, the french, indian war, is captured, in, its utter brutality, beauty, complete, with, the many driving ambitions, clashing, cultures, of, everyone involved.this movie, has, a bit, of, everything, including, action, romance, war, passionate drama, the director, michael mann, knows, the story, well, does, completely discard, james, fenimore cooper, source material, which some have, dubbed, as, being, racist and totally unfair, in, its portrait, of, native americans.the story, a story, is, all over, the place, with, three frontier scouts, hawkeye, daniel day-lewis, chingachgook, russell, means, uncas, eric schweig, escorting, a british colonel, daughters, cora and alice munro, madeleine stowe and jodhi, may, respectively, to, safety, at, besieged, fort william henry, major duncan, heyward, steven, waddington, rivals, hawkeye, for, cora, affections and a vengeance-driven huron, named, magua, wes, studi, seeks, to, have, both daughters, killed, ...]",-5.526422123843756,-17.47578385233426,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,5.972602739726027,146,166,last mohicans popular acclaimed films 1992 vision early america french indian war captured utter brutality beauty complete many driving ambitions clashing cultures everyone involved movie bit everything including action romance war passionate drama director michael mann knows story well completely discard james fenimore coopers source material dubbed racist totally unfair portrait native americans story story place frontier scouts hawkeye daniel day lewis chingachgook russell means uncas eric schweig escorting british colonels daughters cora alice munro madeleine stowe jodhi may respectively safety besieged fort william henry major duncan heyward steven waddington rivals hawkeye coras affections vengeance driven huron named magua wes studi seeks daughters killed retribution loss children far manns best film yet ranks 15 time favorite movies list uses lush wilderness settings great effect makes good use editing actually comes handy showcasing brutal violence dominates much films action sequences films last 20 minutes definite stunner described classic vicious great movie shows america infancy complete rivalries intrigue violence sure everyday part life hectic time period 10 10,0.12953431372549018,0.4923202614379085,1
The Legend of Bhagat Singh (2002) - IMDb,"The Legend of Bhagat Singh is one of Indian cinema's most ambitious projects to date.  After three years of painstaking research and set construction, veteran film maker Raj Kumar Santoshi and actor Ajay Devgan shot the film in a short stretch of six months.  The film released early due to competition from other films dealing with roughly the same subject.  Overall it's a pretty solid film but one can't help shake the feeling that it could have been a far superior product if it had been worked on for a short while longer.The film tells the entire life story of Indian freedom fighter and martyr Bhagat Singh who, in a nut shell, grew disillusioned with Gandhi's passive movement and lead an independent violent struggle against the British.Colonial India is recreated magnificently in the film and the British atrocities committed are portrayed with aplomb by the director.  One can truly get a sense of how such frustrating conditions could drive youngsters to violence and revolt.  Some of the film's strengths are its hard hitting portrayal of British atrocities, its court scenes and its action scenes.The film's biggest highlight is its lead performer, Indian actor Ajay Devgan.  The actor single handedly manages to uplift even the most dull and unconvincing scenes in the film to a high quality level.  His every expression and mannerism is carefully calculated to maximize his impact on the viewer.  This man can move audiences to tears or wide smiles with just a few short lines and quick glances from his intense eyes.  His work here is par excellence and can easily rival any work done by any grade-A actors the world over.The supporting cast is good as well, with fellow revolutionary Sukhdev (Indian stage actor Sushant Singh) Bhagat Singh's mother (Indian diva Farida Jalal) leaving lasting impressions as well.The last excellent thing about the movie is the music by renowned composer A.R. Rahman.  The music is not as festive as Bollywood movies usually boast, but that's to be expected considering the subject of the film.  The well crafted, soothing ethnic tunes manage to evoke the right emotions without seeming rash and distasteful.The film isn't without its weaknesses, however.  For one, it's obviously a rushed effort.  Segments of the script seem under developed and the impact of certain national tragedies on Bhagat Singh's mindset is never fleshed out as one would want them to be.Also, Bhagat Singh's political ideology (he was a communist, by the way) is never really spelled out for viewers.  Instead, they are left to put together pieces for themselves connecting the dots from dialogs and incidents in the film to really figure out the main character's mindset and view points.The second half of the film moves at an awkward pace, sometimes lingering on minute details and other times racing ahead and skipping crucial events (which are referenced in later dialog).  Finally, for a film that remains very objective in presenting most events, viewers will be surprised by a very negative portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi and India's first Prime Minister Nehru.  This angle of the film stuck out like a sore thumb to say the least.For all its faults however, Legend of Bhagat Singh has plenty of strengths to make it a superb film.  It tells a great story with style and conviction. It has wonderful performances including one of finest performances ever in Indian cinema by Devgan.  It has great action, moving drama, soothing music, and is (overall) a thoroughly rewarding and entertaining experience.  It comes highly recommended by me.",SURJYAKIRAN10,June/2002,10," A Fantastic Bio-pic on an Intriguing Figure, but Not Without Flaws",1,"[legend, bhagat, singh, one, indian, cinema, ambitious, project, date, three, year, painstaking, research, set, construction, veteran, film, maker, raj, kumar, santoshi, actor, ajay, devgan, shot, film, short, stretch, six, month, film, release, early, due, competition, film, deal, roughly, subject, overall, pretty, solid, film, one, help, shake, feel, could, far, superior, product, work, short, film, tell, entire, life, story, indian, freedom, fighter, martyr, bhagat, singh, nut, grow, disillusion, gandhi, passive, movement, lead, independent, violent, struggle, india, recreate, magnificently, film, british, atrocity, commit, portrayed, aplomb, director, one, truly, get, sense, frustrate, condition, could, drive, youngster, violence, revolt, film, strength, hard, hit, portrayal, ...]","[the legend, of, bhagat singh, is, of, indian cinema, most ambitious projects, to, date, after, three years, of, painstaking research, set, construction, veteran film maker raj kumar santoshi and actor, ajay devgan, shot, the film, in, a short stretch, of, six months, the film, released, early due, to, competition, from, other films, dealing, with, roughly, the same subject, overall it, is, a pretty solid film, one, cannot help, shake the feeling, that, it, could have been, a far superior product, if, it, had been worked, on for, a short, while, longer.the film, tells, the entire life story, of, indian freedom fighter and martyr bhagat singh, in, a nut she, will, grew disillusioned, with, gandhi, passive movement, lead, an independent violent struggle, against, the british.colonial india, is recreated, magnificently, in, the film, the british atrocities, committed are portrayed, with, aplomb, by, the director, one, can truly get, a sense, of, how, such frustrating conditions, could drive, youngsters, to, violence, revolt, some of, the film, strengths, are, its hard hitting portrayal, of, british atrocities, its court scenes and its action, scenes.the film, biggest highlight, is, its lead performer, indian actor ajay devgan, ...]",201.40209710337336,-16.683193111125856,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,3,1,1,4,1,3,1,0,1,2,0,6.189922480620155,258,340,legend bhagat singh indian cinemas ambitious projects date years painstaking research set construction veteran film maker raj kumar santoshi actor ajay devgan shot film short stretch months film released early due competition films dealing roughly subject overall pretty solid film help shake feeling could far superior product worked short longer film tells entire life story indian freedom fighter martyr bhagat singh nut shell grew disillusioned gandhis passive movement lead independent violent struggle british colonial india recreated magnificently film british atrocities committed portrayed aplomb director truly sense frustrating conditions could drive youngsters violence revolt films strengths hard hitting portrayal british atrocities court scenes action scenes films biggest highlight lead performer indian actor ajay devgan actor single handedly manages uplift even dull unconvincing scenes film high quality level every expression mannerism carefully calculated maximize impact viewer man move audiences tears wide smiles short lines quick glances intense eyes work par excellence easily rival work done grade actors world supporting cast good well fellow revolutionary sukhdev indian stage actor sushant singh bhagat singhs mother indian diva farida jalal leaving lasting impressions well last excellent thing movie music renowned composer r rahman music festive bollywood movies usually boast expected considering subject film well crafted soothing ethnic tunes manage evoke right emotions without seeming rash distasteful film without weaknesses however obviously rushed effort segments script seem developed impact certain national tragedies bhagat singhs mindset never fleshed would want bhagat singhs political ideology communist way never really spelled viewers instead left put together pieces connecting dots dialogs incidents film really figure main characters mindset view points second half film moves awkward pace sometimes lingering minute details times racing ahead skipping crucial events referenced later dialog finally film remains objective presenting events viewers surprised negative portrayal mahatma gandhi indias first prime minister nehru angle film stuck like sore thumb least faults however legend bhagat singh plenty strengths superb film tells great story style conviction wonderful performances including finest performances ever indian cinema devgan great action moving drama soothing music overall thoroughly rewarding entertaining experience comes highly recommended,0.1003416149068323,0.4698274672187715,1
The Legend of Hercules (2014) - IMDb,"Oh boy. What a ride, so much greatness. Ed Wood would be proud.The Legend of Hercules. This caustic comedy doesn't start at the minute 0 of the movie. The movie in itself is just the tip of the iceberg, to fully understand all the implications and subtlety of this story you have to be familiar with the background. This is NOT an easy movie. Just like Citizen Kane it's a movie you need to DESERVE, as it will not give itself to you too easily.It all starts in a rocking chair next to a swimming-pool. Summer is shining, life is good, whiskey's on the rocks. Some old guy with sun glasses is on the phone, talking while playing Candy Crush.""I'm telling you, people want a gladiator movie. Just like Gladiator, something like that! (Sweet.) Just freaking do something like the series Spartacus, or Rome, I don't (Tasty!) give a damn. I want the script in one week. (Sugar crush.)""One week later 10 screenwriters come up with 10 different scripts. For a movie 10 times better, the guy in the rocking chair decides the movie will be a blend of the 10 scripts.He puts 70 million dollars on the table.The movie is now shot and it's kind of very bad, just how it was supposed to be. It doesn't matter anyway because people just have to go to the cinema once, it's alright if they don't like it and don't come a second time! HA!Worried, some guy calls the money-guy in the rocking chair.""-Hey, I've been thinking, we should use a famous name from the mythology in the title! It will bring more people!-Asklepios?-Eeeehhh, well to be honest I was thinking Hercules...-Oh, alright then.""And so The Legend Of Hercules was born. This movie is not a story, it's money invested and hope for a return. If you make a bad movie but you hit some landmarks: Hercules, mythology, gladiators, somewhat-famous actors, then you'll probably make money.You have to understand the true, deep nature of this movie. The Legend of Hercules is a cry for help, a poetry, a game-changer. The actual purpose of this movie is to impact the global industry, to make producers realize that, no, bad movies actually DON'T WORK, and they are not easy money.A simple, honest, gladiator movie with no fake big name like Hercules, with no fake romance, with just a guy fighting and living in the roman empire would have made more money. It is time to leave the path of using the same recipe over and over again. This is the one and only message this movie conveys, successfully.I hope you'll appreciate The Legend of Hercules as fully as I did.",Astyan24,March/2014,10, A WONDERFUL Criticism Of Traditional Movie-Making,1,"[oh, boy, ride, much, greatness, ed, wood, would, legend, hercules, caustic, comedy, start, minute, movie, movie, tip, iceberg, fully, understand, implication, subtlety, story, familiar, background, easy, movie, like, citizen, kane, movie, need, deserve, give, start, rock, chair, next, summer, shin, life, good, whiskey, rock, old, guy, sun, glass, phone, talk, play, candy, crush, tell, people, want, gladiator, movie, like, gladiator, something, like, sweet, freak, something, like, series, spartacus, rome, tasty, give, damn, want, script, one, week, sugar, crush, one, week, later, screenwriter, come, different, script, movie, time, better, guy, rock, chair, decides, movie, blend, put, million, dollar, movie, shot, kind, ...]","[boy, ride, so much greatness, ed, wood, would be, proud.the legend, of, hercules, this caustic comedy, does not start, at, the minute, of, the movie, the movie, in, itself, is, just, the tip, of, the iceberg, to, fully understand, all the implications, subtlety, of, this story you, have, to, be, familiar, with, the background, is, not, an easy movie, just, like, citizen kane it, is, a movie you, need, to, deserve, as, it, will not give, itself, to, you, too easily.it, starts, in, a rocking chair, next, to, a swimming-pool, summer, is shining, life, is, good, whiskey, 's, on, the rocks, some old guy, with, sun glasses, is, on, the phone, talking, while, playing, candy, am telling, you, people, want, a gladiator movie, just, like, gladiator, something, like, that, sweet, just freaking do something, like, the series, spartacus, rome, i, do, not, tasty, give, ...]",44.211562465658204,12.429160199956995,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,1,4,0,5,0,4,5.472972972972973,148,224,oh boy ride much greatness ed wood would proud legend hercules caustic comedy start minute 0 movie movie tip iceberg fully understand implications subtlety story familiar background easy movie like citizen kane movie need deserve give easily starts rocking chair next swimming pool summer shining life good whiskeys rocks old guy sun glasses phone talking playing candy crush telling people want gladiator movie like gladiator something like sweet freaking something like series spartacus rome tasty give damn want script week sugar crush week later 10 screenwriters 10 different scripts movie 10 times better guy rocking chair decides movie blend 10 scripts puts 70 million dollars table movie shot kind bad supposed matter anyway people cinema alright like second time ha worried guy calls money guy rocking chair hey thinking use famous name mythology title bring people asklepios eeeehhh well honest thinking hercules oh alright legend hercules born movie story money invested hope return bad movie hit landmarks hercules mythology gladiators somewhat famous actors probably money understand true deep nature movie legend hercules cry help poetry game changer actual purpose movie impact global industry producers realize bad movies actually work easy money simple honest gladiator movie fake big name like hercules fake romance guy fighting living roman empire would made money time leave path using recipe message movie conveys successfully hope appreciate legend hercules fully,0.12720588235294117,0.5619747899159664,1
The Legend of Hercules (2014) - IMDb,"The Legend of Hercules is one of two Hercules movies in 2014, the other one is set for release in July starring Dwayne Johnson and Directed by Brett Ratner. And I gotta say, after seeing this movie, I'm really looking forward to the Brett Ratner version, and that's saying something. Where do I begin? The acting is hilariously awful (Kellan Lutz and the villains especially). The romance is laughable. The fight scenes are a total rip off of 300 and Gladiator, with obnoxious slow-mo being used every 10 seconds. And for a movie with a budget of $70 million, it looks cheap.The Legend of Hercules has some of the worst production values I've ever seen in a film.

The Lego Movie (2014) - IMDb,"Like many of you, the first time I saw the trailer for The Lego Movie (2014) I thought to myself, ""Are you kidding me?!"" Yet another movie based on a franchise of toys aimed towards families willing to cough up the cash just to shut their kids up. Can't we for once make movies for kids that don't dull the senses? Have we truly come to the point where there are no original thoughts? Yet after seeing not just families but college kids' line up to see sold out viewings I became interested. In addition, The Lego Movie managed to muster a staggering 93% on rottentomatoes.com, an unheard of fresh score in the February film graveyard. In short; curiosity got the best of me.Boy was I wrong about this film. I honestly couldn't have been more wrong about a film in my life. The Lego Movie is not only the must see film of the late winter season, I'm going to go ahead and call it now; it's the best family-oriented film for all ages of 2014. Okay maybe not but at the very least it's a very high bar to set.The story busts out of the gate from the get-go; Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) a wizard and ""master builder"", while protecting a mystery weapon is blinded by Lord Business (Will Ferrell), obviously our caped and big booted villain. Before Vitruvius is kicked into the abyss by Business and his robotic minions, he foretells of a hero, the ""special"" who will put an end to his dastardly plans, whatever they might be. The next morning Emmet a seemingly ordinary Lego construction worker goes about his normal day. He comes across a woman named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) searching for ""the piece of resistance"" which he unwittingly finds and becomes beholden to. Now it's up to Emmet and some newfound friends to fulfill the prophecy.It all sounds like a scenario dreamed up by a child who's read one too many comic books. Yet within The Lego Movie's brick-blocked world, everything including the story feels incredibly new and original. Children, especially the young will enjoy the fast action, laugh-a-minute jokes, sly slapstick and goofy characters. Obvious kid favorites will include perma-smiled Unikitty (Alison Brie) and zany 80's throwback astronaut Benny (Charlie Day) whose ability to create spaceships is frustratingly overlooked. Plus there's Batman (Will Arnett)Batman! The older crowd however will be astounded not only with the seamless CGI effects but with the subversive element throughout the film. Yes a goofy, kiddy film of such unrestrained chirpiness can be positively incendiary, at least in this case. Throughout the film there are Orwellian elements tucked underneath crafty pop-culture references ranging from Star Wars (1977) to Harry Potter. There are mischievous pokes at what Henry David Thoreau referred to as ""(leading) lives of quite desperation."" Finally there's cheeky satire aimed at the Danish toy brand itself. Much of the conflict revolves around ""master builders"" who build whatever they want out of the parts they find versus Lord Business who wants everything built ""according to the directions."" This particular theme struck the kid inside me as I was very fond of Legos. Younglings may not realize that back in the day, pre-designed Lego play sets took a back seat to the now impossible to find Lego Creative Bucket sets. To the uninitiated that particular red bucket set was an amalgam of potential foot sores but to this writer, those 200+ pieces were a gateway to an unlimited creative space.The Lego Movie accurately and effectively recreates that creative space through accessible movie magic. It exhibits a fun hero story that may not be treading new narrative ground but nonetheless feels fresh and new. Finally the themes and occasionally biting humor makes The Lego Movie a kid's film that isn't just for kids but the child in all of us. This February do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an adventure story unlike any other. Then go home and order some Legos online!

The Longest Day (1962) - IMDb,"This an important, interesting movie depicting the Overlord operation with monumental logistics and means of effecting the Normandy landing, the most difficult campaign of war. The picture brings to life the famous images of WWII and splendidly the most sensational military operation of the history in an Allied hard-fought effort. The film develops the previous days to the D-Day invasion ,such as the landings and the advance over France. The film is magnificently produced with big budget by the great 20th century Fox producer Darryl F Zanuck. Evocative cinematography by Jean Bourgoun and catching song by Paul Anka with musical score by Maurice Jarre. Excellent casting by plethora stars. Special mention to John Wayne as Lt. Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort , he's top-notch as tough,valiant officer in this believable war film and terrific acting by Richard Todd as Major commanding Us paratroopers dropped to protect the flanks of the invasion and taking strategic bridge. Furthermore known Generals and officers played by prestigious players, as Germans: General Gunther(Curt Jurgens),Field Marshal Erwin Rommel(Hinz), Field Marshal Von Rundstedt(Paul Hartmann), and Allied : Brig. General Theodore Roosevelt Jr(Henry Fonda),Brig. General Norman Cota(Robert Mitchum), General Haines(Mel Ferrer), Brig. General James Gavin(Robert Ryan), General Raymond Barton(Edmond O'Brien), Lt General OMar N Bradley(Stuart), General Bernard L Montgomery(T. Reid) and General Dwight D Eisenhower played by Henry Grace. Grace was a famed set designer , while he worked extensively for many films ,his only appearance was an uncredited performance as Eisenhower ; despite not being an actor , he was cast for his uncanny resemblance to the General. This famous event from how was orchestrated the dangerous,risky landings maneuvers is professionally directed by trio of directors, Ken Annakin, Bernhard Wicki and Andrew Marton. Adding more details along with the well developed on the movie, the events were happened of the following manner : Shortly after midnight on June 6, about 23.500 US and British paratroopers landed along the edges of the landing beaches. Their mission was to seize vital bridges and communications centers. They also had to hold off any Germans counterattacks until they were relieved by the amphibious forces. The Airbone landings were largely successful. Some US troops missed their target and end up scattered over the countryside. The main amphibious landings took place after an artillery bombardment from some 200 Allied warships at German positions also came under attack from Allied medium and heavy bombers. They were part of the 11,500 aircraft committed to D-Day. They bombed the Germans on and behind the five landing beaches. US troops landed on Utah beach. Strong currents and inaccurate navigation meant that they were a little away from their precise target. They landed about 1 mile(1,6 km) south. The beach there was relatively undefended. The troops soon knocked out the only concrete gun position guarding the beach.Demolitions teams cleared paths through the obstacles the beach and the first tanks crossed the Atlantic Wall. They fanned out into the countryside to link up with the paratroopers. By nightfall of D-Day some 23,000 men and 1,700 vehicles had gone ashore. The beach had been highly congested for much of the day. Utah was a triumph ,however Omaha beach was nearly a disaster, the fight was the most difficult. The Us troops were unable to get off the beach to make room for later waves of invaders. There were better defenses there than on the other beaches, and the German defenders were positioned on high ground, from where they could pour fire down on the attackers.The allies also made mistakes. The naval bombardment ended too soon, and the bombers missed their targets and launched landing crafts and amphibious tanks too far out from the beach, may were sunk. When the first assault wave landed ,it faced a bar-rage of fire , some men were thinking of evacuation. However small groups began to make it off the beach to the high ground beyond. By dusk, some men were ashore, most were still crowed on the beach. The high ground beyond was only thinly held by exhausted survivors waves. Some 2300 US troops had been killed in the landings. The operation had come close to disaster. The three Anglo-Canadian beaches-Gold, Sword and Juno stretched fore some 25 miles. They were wide and open and ideal for amphibious landings. The British on Gold and Sword quickly crashed though the Atlantic wall. Their success was due partly to a range of specially developed armored vehicles known as Funnies. The Canadians at Juno had a tougher time. They faced rough seas and alert defenders .By late morning ,they were also pushing inland. Despite the horror of beaches , overall Allied losses were far lower than expected. Some 6000 US personnel were killed, wounded, or missing, along with 4300 British and Canadian troops. German losses totaled between 4000 and 8000. By the day's end ,some 128000 Allied soldiers were ashore and many more were on their way.",ma-cortes21,December/2007,8," Spectacular recounting about the D-Day landings at Normandy on June 6, 1944,

The Magnificent Seven (1960) - IMDb,"I recently subjected ""The Magnificent Seven"" to just about the toughest test imaginable--I watched it just a few days after ""Seven Samurai."" And while I'm not going to pretend it's on par with Kurosawa's astounding masterpiece, I have to tip my hat to Hollywood on this one: it's good, DAMN good, among the best American Westerns.The focus of the screenplay is more on post-Bogart-pre-Eastwood cool banter than the gradual, taciturn character development of ""Seven Samurai,"" but that doesn't mean that the film doesn't have a heart. Considering it clocks in at barely over two hours (compared to the marathonic three and a half of ""Samurai""), it actually does a fantastic and very economical job of fleshing out its memorable cast of characters.One particularly wonderful scene that stuck in my memory from the first time I saw the film ten years ago is the one where Lee (Robert Vaughn), drunk in the middle of the night, confesses his frailties and fear to two of the farmers. The scene (along with the general story of these down-and-out heroes) was groundbreaking in that it began the deconstruction and deromanticization of the Western hero which would be brought to fruition in Sergio Leone's unparalleled spaghetti Westerns.The star-studded cast wouldn't hold up doing Shakespeare, but they're ideal in this gunslinging, cool-talking tough-guy adventure. As if a lineup of heroes that included Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn wasn't enough, Eli Wallach steals the show as the Mexican bandit chief, a worthy precursor to his classic role ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" If the screenplay has a major flaw, it's that his character isn't featured more.The score is, of course, one of the all-time classics. And while not as alive visually as the Japanese film that inspired it or the Italian Westerns it influenced, it's still mighty fine to look at, and the gunfights don't disappoint.The pieces add up to one of the great entertaining films of all time, which still manages to be moving and morally aware despite its Hollywoodization of Kurosawa's vision.",byght18,October/2004,9, About as good as remakes get,1,"[recently, subject, magnificent, seven, toughest, test, imaginable, watch, day, seven, samurai, go, pretend, par, kurosawa, astound, masterpiece, tip, hat, hollywood, one, good, damn, good, among, best, american, focus, screenplay, cool, banter, gradual, taciturn, character, development, seven, samurai, mean, film, heart, consider, clock, barely, two, hour, compare, marathonic, three, half, samurai, actually, fantastic, economical, job, flesh, memorable, cast, particularly, wonderful, scene, stuck, memory, first, time, saw, film, ten, year, ago, one, lee, robert, vaughn, drunk, middle, night, confesses, frailty, fear, two, farmer, scene, along, general, story, hero, groundbreaking, begin, deconstruction, deromanticization, western, hero, would, brought, fruition, sergio, leone, unparalleled, spaghetti, cast, ...]","[i, recently subjected, magnificent, to, just, about, the toughest test imaginable--i, watched, it, just, a few days, after, while, i, am not going, to, pretend, it, is, on, par, with, kurosawa, astounding masterpiece, i, have, to, tip, my hat, to, hollywood, on, it, is, good, damn good, among, the best american, westerns.the focus, of, the screenplay, is, more, on, post-bogart-pre-eastwood cool banter, than, the gradual, taciturn character development, of, does not mean, that, the film, does not have, a heart, considering, it, clocks, in at, barely, over, two hours, compared, to, marathonic, three and a half, of, it, actually does, fantastic and, very economical job, of, fleshing, out, its memorable cast, of, characters.one particularly wonderful scene, that, stuck, in, my memory, from, the first time i, saw, the film, ten years, ago is, where, lee, robert vaughn, drunk, in, the middle, of, the night, confesses, his frailties and fear, to, of, the farmers, the scene, ...]",4.7451495415164695,-16.77230052840139,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,6.298013245033113,151,175,recently subjected magnificent toughest test imaginable watched days samurai going pretend par kurosawas astounding masterpiece tip hat hollywood good damn good among best american westerns focus screenplay post bogart pre eastwood cool banter gradual taciturn character development samurai mean film heart considering clocks barely hours compared marathonic half samurai actually fantastic economical job fleshing memorable cast characters particularly wonderful scene stuck memory first time saw film ten years ago lee robert vaughn drunk middle night confesses frailties fear farmers scene along general story heroes groundbreaking began deconstruction deromanticization western hero would brought fruition sergio leones unparalleled spaghetti westerns star studded cast would hold shakespeare ideal gunslinging cool talking tough guy adventure lineup heroes included yul brynner steve mcqueen charles bronson james coburn enough eli wallach steals show mexican bandit chief worthy precursor classic role good bad ugly screenplay major flaw character featured score course time classics alive visually japanese film inspired italian westerns influenced still mighty fine look gunfights disappoint pieces add great entertaining films time still manages moving morally aware despite hollywoodization kurosawas vision,0.22777777777777777,0.5351041666666666,1
The Magnificent Seven (1960) - IMDb,"Growing up in the 1970s, ""The Magnificent Seven"" was the kind of movie you respected even without seeing it. ""I'll be Vin!"" ""I'll be Chris!"" ""I'll be the guy Charles Bronson plays!"" You weren't quick, and you'd be stuck with Harry Luck.So speaking as the Harry Luck guy, I can't see what the fuss was about.The film introduces us to a Mexican village being robbed of its corn by the cruel bandito Calvera (Eli Wallach). A trio of villagers reach out out to gunslinger Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) for help. He assembles six like-minded killers for hire, and the seven put themselves on the line to protect the village.""I promise you we'll all teach him something about the price of corn,"" Chris vows.Because ""The Magnificent Seven"" joins Brynner with such 1960s luminaries as Steve McQueen (Vin), Charles Bronson (Bernardo), James Coburn (Britt), and Robert Vaughn (Lee), I think ""The Magnificent Seven"" is given more credit than it deserves. For one thing, director John Sturges ignores all of them in favor of Horst Buchholz as an impetuous Mexican who overplays every scene he's in. For another, the film never realistically offers reasons for why its characters lay their lives on the line.The idea of these gunmen joining forces to protect a village is a good set-up. I never saw ""The Seven Samurai"" and can't complain about a rip-off like other user reviews here. ""Star Wars"" and ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" are great movies that took their plots from the same Japanese director, so the idea isn't wrong on its own. I just wish ""The Magnificent Seven"" did more with the material.Spatial reality goes by the boards every time there's a gunfight, people shooting and being killed completely independent of one another. Sturges in combat scenes played to what his audience wanted (stars shooting guns and bad guys falling, until the end when it's the other way around) regardless of what made sense.McQueen sticks out for his laconic dialogue and his willingness to wear a pink shirt. He and Coburn are big film heroes of mine, and both are well presented. ""You lose"", Coburn says at one point, his lean frame all the authority he needs to sell the idea that it really does make sense bringing a knife to a gunfight. Bronson likewise shines in a more challenging role, having to nursemaid three badly-dubbed Mexican boys.Sturges needed more time than he used to develop Vaughn's less steady character, as well as Brad Dexter's role of Harry Luck, a golddigger who never fits into the narrative. Like Glenn Erickson, a.k.a. ""DVD Savant"", said in his otherwise admiring review of the film, it's like he plays a 1940s character in a 1960 film. Most fatally, too much time is spent on Buchholz's Chico character, annoying not because of Buchholz's weakness as an actor but because of the way the character is written. When he confronts Chris and the gang in a bar, you just know he's going to knock over a row of whiskey jiggers before he does, because of the obvious way the scene is set up.SPOILERS - Why Calvera lets the Magnificent Seven ride off with their guns is one of those questions that makes clear this is a film focused on star-making over common sense. Also, as Damarates noted in his March 2007 review, why do Chris and the rest of the Seven put themselves out for a village that obviously betrayed them? When you think of it, Calvera is the only halfway decent character in the movie, giving his opponents the (unmerited) benefit of the doubt - SPOILERS ENDNot a good movie, except for those with memories of how it was when you were kids, this movie was fresh in your hearts, and you weren't stuck playing Harry Luck.",slokes11,August/2010,4, The Price Of Corn,0,"[grow, magnificent, seven, kind, movie, respect, even, without, see, vin, chris, guy, charles, bronson, play, quick, would, stuck, harry, speak, harry, luck, guy, see, fuss, film, introduces, u, mexican, village, robbed, corn, cruel, bandito, calvera, eli, wallach, trio, villager, reach, gunslinger, chris, adam, yul, brynner, help, assembles, six, killer, hire, seven, put, line, protect, village, promise, teach, something, price, corn, chris, magnificent, seven, join, brynner, luminary, steve, mcqueen, vin, charles, bronson, bernardo, james, coburn, britt, robert, vaughn, lee, think, magnificent, seven, give, credit, deserves, one, thing, director, john, sturges, ignores, favor, horst, buchholz, impetuous, mexican, overplays, every, scene, another, film, ...]","[growing, up in, the 1970s, magnificent, was, the kind, of, movie you, respected, even, without, seeing, it, i, will be, vin, i, will be chris, i, will be, the guy charles, bronson plays, you, were, not quick, you, would be stuck, with, harry, speaking as, the harry luck guy, i, cannot see, the fuss, was, about.the film, introduces, us, to, a mexican village, being robbed, of, its corn, by, the cruel bandito calvera, eli wallach, a trio, of, villagers, reach, out out to, gunslinger, chris adams, yul brynner, help, he, assembles, six like-minded killers, hire, the seven put themselves, on, the line, to, protect, the village.""i promise you we, will, all teach him, something, about, the price, of, corn, chris, magnificent, joins, brynner, with, such, 1960s luminaries, as, steve, mcqueen, vin, charles, bronson, bernardo, james, coburn, britt, robert vaughn, lee, i, think, magnificent, is given, more credit, than, it, deserves, for, ...]",173.28062460349616,-2.743196312191422,0,1,1,1,0,2,1,0,3,3,1,1,4,1,3,1,0,1,2,0,5.5887445887445875,231,324,growing 1970s magnificent kind movie respected even without seeing vin chris guy charles bronson plays quick would stuck harry luck speaking harry luck guy fuss film introduces us mexican village robbed corn cruel bandito calvera eli wallach trio villagers reach gunslinger chris adams yul brynner help assembles like minded killers hire put line protect village promise teach something price corn chris vows magnificent joins brynner 1960s luminaries steve mcqueen vin charles bronson bernardo james coburn britt robert vaughn lee think magnificent given credit deserves thing director john sturges ignores favor horst buchholz impetuous mexican overplays every scene another film never realistically offers reasons characters lay lives line idea gunmen joining forces protect village good set never saw samurai complain rip like user reviews star wars fistful dollars great movies took plots japanese director idea wrong wish magnificent material spatial reality goes boards every time gunfight people shooting killed completely independent another sturges combat scenes played audience wanted stars shooting guns bad guys falling end way around regardless made sense mcqueen sticks laconic dialogue willingness wear pink shirt coburn big film heroes mine well presented lose coburn says point lean frame authority needs sell idea really sense bringing knife gunfight bronson likewise shines challenging role nursemaid badly dubbed mexican boys sturges needed time used develop vaughns less steady character well brad dexters role harry luck golddigger never fits narrative like glenn erickson k dvd savant said otherwise admiring review film like plays 1940s character 1960 film fatally much time spent buchholzs chico character annoying buchholzs weakness actor way character written confronts chris gang bar know going knock row whiskey jiggers obvious way scene set spoilers calvera lets magnificent ride guns questions makes clear film focused star making common sense damarates noted march 2007 review chris rest put village obviously betrayed think calvera halfway decent character movie giving opponents unmerited benefit doubt spoilers endnot good movie except memories kids movie fresh hearts stuck playing harry luck,0.14722222222222225,0.5034722222222222,1

The Marine (2006) - IMDb,"I saw this movie on TV and it left me in a state of confusion. I simply could not understand why the people making this movie, made so many misstakes. And what was up with those opening scenes? I got Rambo flashbacks during that. I consider myself to be within the target audience, boys who like action movies with guns, babes, car chases, fights and so on. The problem with this movie IMO is that it underestimates its audience. Just because we like action movies, does not mean we like movies with just action scenes. Nor does it mean that you do not have to make any sense.10 years ago i would have thought that this movie was tha bombe. I would have thought that it was cool. However this is not 1999, it's 2009 (yes, i know the movie is from 2006). After all the things that have happened in the last couple of years, you simply can not show such unbelievable stuff as getting shot at a 120 times from 3-10 meters away during a car chase and not get hit once (outside the Matrix of course).This movie made me doubt myself. Have i learned so much about combat tactics, guns and ammo, warfare, law enforcement, crime and human frailty (from watching Discovery Channel and National Geographic) that i am simply incapable of enjoying a simple action movie? After thinking a lot about that i concluded that the answer is yes. Yes, i know to much to enjoy a simple action movie. And The Marine is about as simple as it gets. A bit more work on the script to make it more logical and coherent and this movie would have scored at least 1 more point (probably 2). I know the marines are tough guys, but i also know marines are not dumb. Stubborn yes, but not dumb. The marine in The Marine is tough and dumb.The Marine is fun to watch, but only when you have nothing else to do. If you need to kill some time, then The Marine will kill it. And you will watch it all the way to the end because of Kelly Carlson. If you are a man you want her to be your lover or hostage. If you are a strait woman or gay man, Kelly Carlson's hair will make you go ""oh wow, look at that, that is hot"". But remember, if you want to enjoy it for more than Kelly Carlson, dumb yourself down a bit.I gave this movie 5 stars. 1 for Kelly Carlson and her hair, 1 for Robert Patrick and his lines, 1 for the guns, fights and explosions, 1 for the cat-fight and 1 for giving me hope that one day someone will give me a multimillion dollar budget to make my own action movie.",FatandUgly16,December/2009,5, Thank you Kelly Carlson,0,"[saw, movie, tv, left, state, confusion, simply, could, understand, people, make, movie, make, many, misstakes, opening, scene, get, rambo, flashback, consider, within, target, audience, boy, like, action, movie, gun, babe, car, chase, fight, problem, movie, imo, underestimate, audience, like, action, movie, mean, like, movie, action, scene, mean, make, year, ago, would, thought, movie, tha, bombe, would, thought, cool, however, yes, know, movie, thing, happen, last, couple, year, simply, show, unbelievable, stuff, get, shot, time, meter, away, car, chase, get, hit, outside, matrix, course, movie, make, doubt, learn, much, combat, tactic, gun, ammo, warfare, law, enforcement, crime, human, frailty, watch, discovery, ...]","[i, saw, this movie, on, tv and it, left, me, in, a state, of, confusion, i, simply could not understand, why, the people, making, this movie, made, so many misstakes, was, up with, those opening scenes, i, got, rambo flashbacks, during, that, i consider myself, to, be, within, the target audience, boys, like, action movies, with, guns, babes, car chases, fights, so on, the problem, with, this movie imo, is, that, it, underestimates, its audience, just, because, we, like, action movies, does not mean, we, like, movies, with, just action scenes, does, it, mean, that, you, do not have, to, make, any sense.10 years, ago i, would have thought, that, this movie, was tha, bombe, i, would have thought, that, it, was, cool, however, is, not, it, is, i know the movie, is, from, after, all the things, have happened, in, the last couple, of, years, you, simply, can, not, ...]",41.48910012688321,16.625026737769524,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,1,4,0,2,0,4,5.223776223776223,143,224,saw movie tv left state confusion simply could understand people making movie made many misstakes opening scenes got rambo flashbacks consider within target audience boys like action movies guns babes car chases fights problem movie imo underestimates audience like action movies mean like movies action scenes mean sense 10 years ago would thought movie tha bombe would thought cool however 1999 2009 yes know movie 2006 things happened last couple years simply show unbelievable stuff getting shot 120 times 3 10 meters away car chase hit outside matrix course movie made doubt learned much combat tactics guns ammo warfare law enforcement crime human frailty watching discovery channel national geographic simply incapable enjoying simple action movie thinking lot concluded answer yes yes know much enjoy simple action movie marine simple gets bit work script logical coherent movie would scored least 1 point probably 2 know marines tough guys know marines dumb stubborn yes dumb marine marine tough dumb marine fun watch nothing else need kill time marine kill watch way end kelly carlson man want lover hostage strait woman gay man kelly carlsons hair oh wow look hot remember want enjoy kelly carlson dumb bit gave movie 5 stars 1 kelly carlson hair 1 robert patrick lines 1 guns fights explosions 1 cat fight 1 giving hope day someone give multimillion dollar budget action movie,0.03457602339181287,0.419329573934837,1
The Matrix (1999) - IMDb,"Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: a Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.",notoriousCASK11,April/2018,10, Welcome to the Real World.,1,"[without, doubt, one, best, influential, movie, time, matrix, define, science, fiction, film, big, leap, genre, take, since, stanley, kubrick, space, odyssey, ridley, scott, blade, runner, matrix, motion, picture, raise, bar, film, come, also, redefine, action, genre, thrill, action, sequence, revolutionary, visual, film, tell, story, thomas, anderson, computer, hacker, world, hack, go, alias, neo, contact, mysterious, outlaw, morpheus, always, question, reality, awaken, truth, world, living, simulated, reality, call, matrix, nothing, slave, dystopian, world, create, control, power, direction, script, wachowskis, fantastic, drew, idea, inspiration, every, great, cyberpunk, movie, anime, film, combine, stun, action, put, one, picture, enough, style, substance, subtext, everyone, end, ...]","[without, a doubt, of, best and, most influential movies, of, all time, the matrix, is, the defining science fiction film, of, 's, biggest, leap, the genre, has taken, since, stanley kubrick, a space odyssey, ridley scott, blade runner, the matrix, is, a ground-breaking motion picture, that, not only raised, the bar, for, all the science-fiction films, to, come, after, it, also redefined, the action genre, with, its thrilling action sequences, revolutionary visual effects.the film, tells, the story, of, thomas, anderson, a computer hacker, that in, the world, of, hacking, goes, by, the alias, of, neo, when, he, is contacted, by, the mysterious outlaw, morpheus, having always questioned, his reality, he, is awakened, to, the truth, that, the world he, is been living, is, simulated, reality, called, the matrix, that, he, is nothing, more, than, a slave, in, this dystopian world, created, controlled, by, powered, machines.the direction, script, by, the wachowskis, is, fantastic, as, they, drew, ideas and inspirations, from, every other great sci-fi, cyberpunk movie, anime, before, ...]",94.96564094776724,-10.667563582886077,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,1,1,4,0,5,5,4,6.5487179487179485,195,254,without doubt best influential movies time matrix defining science fiction film 1990s biggest leap genre taken since stanley kubricks 2001 space odyssey ridley scotts blade runner matrix ground breaking motion picture raised bar science fiction films redefined action genre thrilling action sequences revolutionary visual effects film tells story thomas anderson computer hacker world hacking goes alias neo contacted mysterious outlaw morpheus always questioned reality awakened truth world living simulated reality called matrix nothing slave dystopian world created controlled powered machines direction script wachowskis fantastic drew ideas inspirations every great sci fi cyberpunk movie anime film combining stunning action putting picture enough style substance subtext everyone ended giving interpretation story research went preparation screenplay quite extensive manner presented big screen impressive every character presented film well defined arc purpose motivations clear cinematography impeccable innovative use camera angles movements zooms slow motion captures different color palette used differentiate matrix real world editing flawless makes sure every scene integral story ensures pace film stays ferocious entire runtime frame packed much visual information viewer devour visual effects introduced us bullet time effect impact still felt todays movies performances incredible member cast gave best performances brought characters portray life stands hugo weavings disciplined rendition character agent smith powerful computer program made search destroy human rebellion undoubtedly greatest performance career conclusion matrix masterpiece everyone thought provoking inventive pioneering influential stylish movies time full philosophical religious allegories waiting interpretation immortal contribution cinema pop culture brilliant combination inventive visual effects excellent vision exquisite action easily makes best influential entertaining movies ever made,0.372962962962963,0.5591975308641975,1

The Musketeer (2001) - IMDb,"This is a movie that really doesn't know what it is. For one thing, it seems to try and hang on to some parts of the story by Dumas, and yet it also is an entirely different story. Seemingly, the only real similarities are the names of the characters. This movie would be much more effective if it was entirely its own story, and not using the names of the famous characters. The reason? This movie totally dashes the names of those characters.The most unsettling part for me was the fact that the Three Musketeers are nothing like themselves. Porthos is not the least bit arrogant or over-the-top. Aramis isn't religious at all. And Athos does not even remotely resemble the character in the book. Sadly, Justin Chambers makes a better d'Artagnan than Chris O' Donnell, but only because he doesn't do any acting at all, which is better than the profuse overacting of O' Donnell. And Stephen Rea is a good actor, but his character isn't remotely as menacing as Richelieu should be.With all of that said, if you just view it as a movie, and try to block the actual story out of your mind, it can be entertaining. The fight scenes are very well done, and the pacing keeps the viewer interested. Perhaps this movie could have been really good if it was about the story of a musketeer NOT named d'Artagnan, and his unique adventure. But since it tries to be an interpretation of Dumas, it falls miserably short. As a movie, it is so-so, but as far as an interpretation of the famous story, it is absolutely terrible.",bulldawg81107,April/2006,5, Has its highs and lows,0,"[movie, really, know, one, thing, seems, try, hang, part, story, duma, yet, also, entirely, different, story, seemingly, real, similarity, name, character, movie, would, much, effective, entirely, story, use, name, famous, character, reason, movie, totally, dash, name, unsettle, part, fact, three, musketeer, nothing, like, porthos, least, bit, arrogant, aramis, religious, athos, even, remotely, resemble, character, book, sadly, justin, chamber, make, better, chris, donnell, act, better, profuse, overact, donnell, stephen, rea, good, actor, character, remotely, menace, richelieu, say, view, movie, try, block, actual, story, mind, entertain, fight, scene, well, do, pace, keep, viewer, interested, perhaps, movie, could, really, good, story, musketeer, name, ...]","[is, a movie, really does not know, it, is, for, one thing, it, seems, to, try, hang, on to, some parts, of, the story, by, dumas, yet, it, also is, an entirely different story, seemingly, the only real similarities, are, the names, of, the characters, this movie, would be, much more effective, if, it, was, entirely, its, own story, not using, the names, of, the famous characters, the reason, this movie, totally, dashes, the names, of, those characters.the most unsettling part, for, me, was, the fact, that, the three musketeers, are, nothing, like, themselves, porthos, is, not, the least bit, arrogant or over-the-top, aramis, is, not religious, at, athos, does not even remotely resemble, the character, in, the book, sadly, justin chambers, makes, a better d'artagnan, than, chris, o, donnell, only, because, he, does not do, any acting, at, is, better, than, the profuse overacting, of o, donnell, stephen rea is, a good actor, his character, is, not remotely as menacing, as, richelieu, should be.with, ...]",-80.97240961679665,5.083148574929834,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,3,2,4,4,2,0,0,4,4,5,5.848837209302325,86,115,movie really know thing seems hang parts story dumas yet entirely different story seemingly real similarities names characters movie would much effective entirely story using names famous characters reason movie totally dashes names characters unsettling part fact musketeers nothing like porthos least bit arrogant top aramis religious athos even remotely resemble character book sadly justin chambers makes better dartagnan chris donnell acting better profuse overacting donnell stephen rea good actor character remotely menacing richelieu said view movie block actual story mind entertaining fight scenes well done pacing keeps viewer interested perhaps movie could really good story musketeer named dartagnan unique adventure since tries interpretation dumas falls miserably short movie far interpretation famous story absolutely terrible,0.09375,0.5901785714285713,1

The Next Karate Kid (1994) - IMDb,"I cant believe that some people gave this such high marks! First off, I have a hard time believing that this group of thugs would be allowed to go around tormenting students, and sexually harassing girls. The principal OVERHEARS the head thug bullying Julie into meeting him ""at the docks...most girls have to BEG me for an invitation, and you're turning Me down?!?!"" Yet, even though he OVERHEARS this and SEES the girl trying to pull herself away from this dork, the Principal STILL sends HER to the office?!? Yea, right. You cant tell me she is the FIRST girl he has tormented, and you cant tell me that no girls went home and told their parents.It appears that the football coach (?) has his own private gang/ army and he allows them, encourages even, to torture others. He says ""If a student throws a piece of paper on the floor, you make them eat it"" Yea, RIGHT! This gang walks the halls together, dressed like a bunch of 1950 throw-back thugs, in their tight jeans and tight, matching black t-shirts, and black leather belts. GET REAL! And apparently, they also have the right to wander the halls of the school in the middle of the night. No parent would put up with this crap going on in their child's school. If MY kid came home, told me this crap was going on, you can bet Id be on the phone with state superintendent.The coach (?) beats up his students outside, on the field, in broad daylight.

The Prince (2014) - IMDb,"""The Prince"" is entirely unoriginal as it doesn't show us anything we haven't seen before. It's generic and formulaic. Everything in this movie you've seen in other movies that came before it, only those movies did it better and they did it first. Uninspired would be the word. No creativity to be found anywhere.Characters: bland. Action: bland. Story: bland. Cinematography: bland.The setup is (too) similar to ""Taken"" where an ""aged father formerly known as Prince"" who happened to be a big deal in the local crime scene in whatever city two decades ago goes looking for his missing daughter killing a bunch of bad guys along the way.The movie tries and fails to establish the main character as this legendary criminal who kicked butt long ago and who now has come back to his old turf in order to save his daughter. How do we know he is this legendary tough guy? Mostly because people in the movie claim that he is (please: show, don't tell), but Jason Patric just can't pull it off as the lead, even if he might be an otherwise competent actor.I think this is mostly the result of poorly written dialog & scenes that just fail to sell us on his violent past. He kinda just seems like a nice guy. Maybe if the movie hadn't tried so hard to be ""Taken"" in the first place and instead made the main character appear more vulnerable & relatable, then discrepancy between what we are promised and what we actually get to see wouldn't be so glaring.Speaking of promises: Despite what the movie poster might imply, neither Bruce Willis nor John Cusack get much screen time, though it's not like their characters are interesting in any way. More screen time with them wouldn't have saved the movie. Willis doesn't give a damn because ""yay money"" and Cussack apparently lost a bet or something, because why else would he want to be part of this movie.I don't mind unoriginal movies, if at least they are well executed in a ""guilty pleasure"" kind of way. A good example of this would be the semi-recent sci-fi action flick ""Lock-Up"", a movie which scratches certain itches and succeeds to be entertaining, even if it has no Oscar worthy performances or a mind-blowing story. ""The Prince"" doesn't provide any guilty pleasure. It provides a reason to call customer service and demand your money back or at least a free rental of ""Lock-Up"".Some may say ""Well it's a genre movie. It doesn't try to reinvent the wheel. Take it for what it is: An action movie!"" I am. The movie doesn't succeed. I have watched my fair share of Jet Li/Jason Statham/Vin Diesel etc. movies and suffered through mediocre acting and story telling and in turn got rewarded with at least a couple of interestingly choreographed fight scenes or otherwise neat visuals or interesting set pieces. Not so here. It's just some guy punching or shooting bad guys at boring locations. No interesting fight choreography, camera work, tension... nothing. Most of the action involves our main guy being shot at by incompetent stormtroopers... I mean bad guys, quickly taking cover, then eventually shooting the bad guys because they suck at taking cover -> Level complete.It's not that the people involved in this movie were entirely incompetent, the actors are doing an okay job, the lighting is fine, the camera is, well... capturing what needs to be captured, the story is at least not a confusing mess, the character motivations are mostly clear etc., but ultimately nothing in this movie stands out as original or particularly well done. There is not a single ""Hey, that was cool/interesting/impressive."" moment.""The Prince"" will leave you entirely unsatisfied as you won't care about any of the characters or the twist-free conclusion nor will you get a rush out of any of the action scenes. This movie is not worth your time and especially not worth your money. It's an incredibly lazy straight-to-rental cash-in, using Willis and Cusack to lure people into watching it.

The Pyramid (2014) - IMDb,"I watched this movie despite its bad reviews because I liked the fact that it is a horror movie in a pyramid and I also quite like movies that have to do with Egyptian history. So after having watched it, I have to say that the one and a half hour I spend doing that was worth it. The pyramid might not be a masterpiece but it is definitely a horror movie worth watching.Firstly, I have to say that the settings were well made as well as the monsters. The actors did a good job too. I can't say that they were amazing but their acting seemed quite natural and they were well directed. Another fact I liked about this movie is that it was decently scary(enough to scare the average watcher) and intense. I quite enjoyed most killing scenes too. In that aspect I think it was better than most horror movies I've seen lately . It could have been more intense though.Coming to the bad points now, as you can probably can guess already the plot is not something new or groundbreaking. You won't see something entirely new here. The only thing that's somewhat ""new"" is that the killings happen in a pyramid. In addition, the movie is not evenly good for its entirety. It starts well, shows promise and is pretty good for a big part but the last part of the movie ruins that feeling. Some scenes of the last part of the movie are not that well-though. Add to that the fact that they probably overdid it a bit with the selection of the ""monster"" and you can understand why it has bad critics. They involved Egyptian mythology a bit too much I guess but I won't spoil further. To sum it up, The pyramid is a horror movie worth watching despite its flaws.

The Pyramid (2014) - IMDb,"This is not a very good movie. The premise may sound promising. The archaeological angle on horror is one that's always interested me, and The Pyramid throws some Greek Mythology in the mix for good measure. Well, the most mythological thing you'll experience during this movie is wishing Hades would drag you into the underworld so you'd never have to remember this atrocity. It's so bad.Visually it reminded me of Alien vs Predator and As Above, So Below, so it's not very original. Atmospherically it reminded me of The Descent, which dealt with claustrophobia infinitely better than this. It's your standard ""team trapped underground"" story where they get picked off one by one. Problem is, every character is one-dimensional so their deaths leave absolutely no impact. The characters themselves are irrational and annoying. ""Hey, we just heard harrowing screams from our friend back there, let's split up!"" Great plan. Oh, and the villains in this movie are one of a kind: Pussy cats. Yeah. Killer cats. And don't worry, the big bad wolf shows up too but I'd rather not say anymore because it's truly a catastrophe best seen for yourself. This is just a dumb movie. I don't know how else to say it.

The Raid 2 (2014) - IMDb,"Note: Check me out as the ""Asian Movie Enthusiast"" on YouTube, where I review tons of Asian movies.The Raid 2: Berandal (2014) (Indonesian Action).Viewed on March 28th at the Regal E-Walk cinema in the heart of New York City.After surviving the apartment building raid, Iko Uwais goes undercover to take down an Indonesian crime syndicate that is feuding with an invasive Japanese yakuza clan in Jakarta. Things get out of control and everything goes to hell. That's the plot in a nutshell.The fighting is the main draw of this film. Martial arts films are frequently under-appreciated because critics tend to downplay the artistry of orchestrating a fight sequence. In some ways it's like staging a complex dance with extremely difficult performances by physical talents who have spent their entire lives perfecting their craft. In many cases it can be even more challenging than executing a good dramatic moment. With that said, ""The Raid 2"" is an exquisite ballet of death with an incredible variety of expertly crafted action sequences that have a grounded, realistic feel to them. It's hard to describe, but despite the insane action there's very little outrageousness present. The choreography here is some of the best ever put on film.There is no question that Uwais is currently the premiere martial arts star, and there is certainly no question that Gareth Evans is the greatest action director on the planet. This man is a genius in terms of visually expressing action through vivid, mind-blowing camera-work. This guy never directed a car chase sequence in his life, and yet his very first attempt is impressive. I did notice a bit more shaky cam in this film when compared to its predecessor, but one can see everything so it's not a problem. Evans is also a pro to create a crescendo of action where every fight seems to outdo the one before it. This generates an absolutely thrilling final hour that will go down in history.The gory violence of ""The Raid 2"" is a big ""screw you"" to PG-13 action movies. Some critics are already whining about the graphic bloodletting, but these are the same guys who hand out 90% approval ratings to movies with incompetent action and no edge – *cough* ""The Hunger Games 2: Catching Fire"" (2013) *cough*. The gore in ""The Raid 2"" isn't just randomly thrown in either. It's a logical consequence of the situation and characters, and it is applied in very creative ways. I have heard that Evans was only coerced to cut a few ""frames"" due to the MPAA review, but I have no idea which frames those were because the now infamous shotgun kill is present in its full, unadulterated glory.The $4.5 million budget is an even bigger ""screw you"" to mega budget Hollywood blockbusters. ""The Raid 2"" has more thrilling action than every $100+ million superhero movie I've ever seen . . . at less than 4.5% of the cost. It's almost unbelievable what these guys can do with a limited budget.Given the exceptional quality of the action, the 148-minute runtime puts some pressure on the story to maintain its momentum between the violence. The first ""Raid"" received much criticism that asserted a generic story and undeveloped characters, but I felt that it nevertheless established a ""feel"" for the characters without the need for long-winded exposition. That ""feel"" can add quite a bit to an action film. ""The Raid 2"" spends more time setting up its premise, which results in some genuine plot and character development. It attempts to do this by taking a generic gangster template and infusing it with a sprawling crime saga that implements many characters. This is essentially a ""chess board"" setup where numerous pieces are first put into place, allowing for many possible confrontations. The viewer is therefore able to relish the moment when a particular piece attacks and takes down another, revealing the actual outcome amidst the countless possibilities. I really liked some of the supporting characters in this, and actually felt a bit sad when they died (even some of the villains!). I am a bit disappointed that both ""Hammer Girl"" and Baseball Bat Man"" are only given a few scenes, but they are certainly memorable. I really liked that brief moment where Hammer Girl picked up her hammers on the bar shelf. It was slightly child-like and innocent, like she was going out to play with friends. This brief, split-second moment can communicate a lot about her character. I suppose it helps to already be a fan of the actors and actresses here, since there are a number of familiar faces from both Indonesian and Japanese film industries. Needless to say, the performances are top notch. The Japanese actors have their little moments, but they could have been given more to do in this. Maybe ""The Raid 3"" will give them more time in the spotlight.Overall, ""The Raid 2"" is a very satisfying action film that justifies its hype after just one viewing. It's simply spectacular.",ebossert28,March/2014,10," The most highly anticipated film of my life, and it actually met those expectations",1,"[note, check, asian, movie, enthusiast, youtube, review,

The Raid: Redemption (2011) - IMDb,"After seeing the trailer, I knew I had to see this movie. Rarely our my high expectation met but The Raid surpassed it. If your seeing this movie, it's because you want to see action and The Raid hit every mark. The action is a mix of shootouts, hand to hand weapons, and mostly good ol' fashioned fists.The Raid proves again how far behind American action films are. I've seen other great foreign action films like Ong-Bak, The Protector, and Ip man but The Raid surpasses them by highlighting a martial art style not shown in any recent films. Its brutal and never lets up. It's not your typical ultra clean fighting that has been done to death but something that looks real and desperate at times as people try to survive outnumbered.Story wise it isn't anything great but at the same time it's better than most martial arts films due to interesting twists and being incredibly well paced to before you know it its over and you want more.If your a fan of action films, there isn't any better out there now or any even close in decades past.",bebop9871,April/2012,9, Possibly the best martial arts film I've seen,1,"[see, trailer, knew, see, movie, rarely, high, expectation, met, raid, surpass, see, movie, want, see, action, raid, hit, every, mark, action, mix, shootout, hand, hand, weapon, mostly, good, ol, fashion, raid, prof, far, behind, american, action, film, see, great, foreign, action, film, like, protector, ip, man, raid, surpasses, highlight, martial, art, style, show, recent, film, brutal, never, let, us, typical, ultra, clean, fight, do, death, something, look, real, desperate, time, people, try, survive, wise, anything, great, time, better, martial, art, film, due, interest, twist, incredibly, well, pace, know, want, fan, action, film, better, even, close, decade, past]","[after, seeing, the trailer, i, knew, i, had, to, see, this movie, rarely, our my, high expectation, met, the raid, surpassed, it, if, your seeing this movie, it, is, because, you, want, to, see, action and the raid, hit, every mark, the action, is, a mix, of, shootouts, hand, to, hand, weapons, mostly good ol, fashioned, fists.the raid, proves, again how far, behind, american action films, are, i, have seen, other great foreign action films, like, ong-bak, the protector, ip man, the raid, surpasses, them, by highlighting, a martial art style, not shown, in, any recent films, its, brutal, never let, us, up, it, is, not, your, typical ultra clean fighting, has been done, to, death, something, looks, real and desperate, at, times, as, people, try, to, survive, outnumbered.story wise it, is, not anything, great, at, the same time it, is, better, than, most martial arts films, due, to, interesting, twists, being incredibly well paced, to, ...]",-100.13224922859732,3.3815623206375807,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,3,2,4,0,2,0,0,4,4,5,5.220779220779222,77,98,seeing trailer knew movie rarely high expectation met raid surpassed seeing movie want action raid hit every mark action mix shootouts hand hand weapons mostly good ol fashioned fists raid proves far behind american action films seen great foreign action films like ong bak protector ip man raid surpasses highlighting martial art style shown recent films brutal never lets typical ultra clean fighting done death something looks real desperate times people survive outnumbered story wise anything great time better martial arts films due interesting twists incredibly well paced know want fan action films better even close decades past,0.14232142857142857,0.4407142857142857,1

The Revenant (2015) - IMDb,"You are almost immediately plunged into the action, in a similar way to the opening of 'Saving Private Ryan', with a Native American attack on a group of fur trappers. DiCaprio even does that momentarily deaf thing that Tom Hanks does. Lots of bows and arrows and gore and excellent photography that is really immersive. Great opening scene.There there's the scene where DiCaprio is mauled by a grizzly bear. Again, really believable, exciting and up front and personal - you can almost smell the bear's stinking breath. Brilliant. And then there's ... well ... not much really. Photography and scenery are by and large excellent but you do get the feeling that better use could have been made of them. Iñárritu often seems to chop scenes around for no particular reason, although you do get the occasional sense of the vast wilderness that comes over well on the big screen.Dialogue is scarce. Most of it goes to Tom Hardy who tries to put on a Texan accent but succeeds in sounding as if he has a sock in his mouth (does he specialise in being inaudible? remember him as the mumbling Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises'?). Then there's the storyline. You know the ending, right? (Just look up the definition of 'revenant'.) Leo is up against it and he suffers a great deal. But you know he is going to survive. So when, to top everything, he falls off a cliff on his horse you realise he's actually become Mr Indestructible. And two and a half hours of crawling, grimacing and wincing does not a very entertaining film make.There are also several non-credible plot twists. Like when Tom Hardy (a.k.a. The Mumbler) somehow cracks an impressive-looking safe and makes off with the garrison money and just two guys go after him, including the garrison commander. This nicely sets up the final confrontation between Mr Indestructible and The Mumbler .... but really? We also develop little or no emotional connection with the main character. The silent dream scenes are a clichéd way of trying to do this and they don't work in my opinion - they're just puzzling and boring. Nor do we see much of the relationship between Leo and his son to set up the emotional links between them - just Leo being harsh and dishing out tough love a couple of times. The pacing is also poor. Once you've passed the opening scene and the grizzly scene, feel free to go and refresh your popcorn - you won't miss much. Overall, the film is self-consciously bleak and overdetermined and is unevenly paced. A better director might possibly have made this a good film but Iñárritu is clearly not David Lean.If DiCaprio gets an Oscar for this it will be because the Academy think they owe him one and possibly because of the hype. This is a film that will be forgotten. If you want to see a good silent movie with snow, ice, struggle for survival and even the odd grizzly bear thrown in, watch Chaplin's 'The Gold Rush' - it's far more entertaining.",mptaylor-5056416,January/2016,3," Great photography, not so great film",0,"[almost, immediately, plunge, action, similar, way, opening, private, ryan, native, american, attack, group, fur, trapper, dicaprio, even, momentarily, deaf, thing, tom, hank, lot, bow, arrow, gore, excellent, photography, really, immersive, great, opening, scene, dicaprio, maul, grizzly, bear, really, believable, excite, front, personal, almost, smell, bear, stink, breath, brilliant, well, much, really, photography, scenery, large, excellent, get, feel, better, use, could, make, iñárritu, often, seem, chop, scene, around, particular, reason, although, get, occasional, sense, vast, wilderness, come, well, big, scarce, go, tom, hardy, try, put, texan, accent, succeeds, sound, sock, mouth, specialise, inaudible, remember, mumble, bane, dark, knight, rise, storyline, know, ...]","[you, are almost immediately plunged, into, the action, in, a similar way, to, the opening, of, saving, private ryan, with, a native american attack, on, a group, of, fur trappers, dicaprio, even does, that, momentarily deaf thing, that, tom hanks, does, lots, of, bows and arrows, gore, excellent photography, is, really immersive, great opening, scene.there, is, the scene, where, dicaprio, is mauled, by, a grizzly bear, again, really believable, exciting, up, front, personal, you, can, almost, smell, bear, stinking, breath, brilliant, then, is, well, not much, really, photography and scenery, are, by, large excellent, you, do get, the feeling, that, better use, could have been made, of, them, iñárritu, often seems, to, chop, scenes, around for, no particular reason, although, you, do get, the occasional sense, of, the vast wilderness, comes, over, well, on, the big screen.dialogue, is, scarce, most, of, it, goes, to, tom, hardy, tries, to, ...]",93.24347089497576,-15.355856142451199,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,1,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.833333333333332,198,250,almost immediately plunged action similar way opening saving private ryan native american attack group fur trappers dicaprio even momentarily deaf thing tom hanks lots bows arrows gore excellent photography really immersive great opening scene scene dicaprio mauled grizzly bear really believable exciting front personal almost smell bears stinking breath brilliant well much really photography scenery large excellent feeling better use could made iñárritu often seems chop scenes around particular reason although occasional sense vast wilderness comes well big screen dialogue scarce goes tom hardy tries put texan accent succeeds sounding sock mouth specialise inaudible remember mumbling bane dark knight rises storyline know ending right look definition revenant leo suffers great deal know going survive top everything falls cliff horse realise actually become indestructible half hours crawling grimacing wincing entertaining film several non credible plot twists like tom hardy k mumbler somehow cracks impressive looking safe makes garrison money guys including garrison commander nicely sets final confrontation indestructible mumbler really develop little emotional connection main character silent dream scenes clichéd way trying work opinion puzzling boring much relationship leo son set emotional links leo harsh dishing tough love couple times pacing poor passed opening scene grizzly scene feel free refresh popcorn miss much overall film self consciously bleak overdetermined unevenly paced better director might possibly made good film iñárritu clearly david lean dicaprio gets oscar academy think owe possibly hype film forgotten want good silent movie snow ice struggle survival even odd grizzly bear thrown watch chaplins gold rush far entertaining,0.1749772313296903,0.5272833723653395,1
The Road Warrior (1981) - IMDb,"Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is a 1981 Australian post-apocalyptic action film directed by George Miller. The film is the second installment in the Mad Max film series, with Mel Gibson starring as Max Rockatansky.I grew up with the Mad Max films and Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior Is my personal favorite best epic Post-Apocalyptic Action Classic Science Fiction film. I always loved The Road Warrior to death this film stayed in my heart. Fury Road and The Road Warrior are Equal for me so I am ranting them 10 and I always tried to take the first film of the Max series as the best one in the franchise but I couldn't, because it is just too dark is not post apocalyptic film enough, it has Drama between the film and the plot starts slow which becomes really boring. The Road Warrior is the opposite of Mad Max which just stayed in my heart and I just love this movie to death and I always will. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior still remains one of the most exhilarating action films to ever grace the screen. The car chases are as excitingly pulse-pounding as ever and no film has yet to surpass the final chase as the best in movie history. Yes, in terms of pure action, not many films have been able to equal The Road Warrior's thrills.Mel Gibson remains the only world-renowned actor in the whole film. He does a terrific job as the character Max, one of his best and most interesting characters. The development of Max is another intriguing component of The Road Warrior, and serves the film by giving it a human edge by featuring Max's slow transformation from loner to savior. Not only that, Gibson also creates a great action hero. There's not a moment in the film when we aren't rooting for Max to smash Humungus and his gang.The Humungus and Wez for me were the best villains ever in the film. Bruce Spence as the gyro-pilot is decent in his role and offers the film's few humorous moments. And also he has a lot of scenes and a lot of things to do in this film. Like flying that flayer helping Max saving him, fighting against Humungus thugs. Emil Minty as The Feral Kid is awesome. The old man as the narrator from the beginning of the film is The Feral Kid, I love the relationship between him and Max. That's what I love in this film the acting is TERRIFIC from the actors. Virginia Hey as Warrior Woman is beautiful and fantastic in this movie. I seriously loved how she acted towards Max that he isn't trust worthy, he needed to win her trust. I love Max's dog he was so better than in the first movie the other dog was. You could even see a personality in this dog. I love this movie to death and will always be in my heart Forever.

The Road Warrior (1981) - IMDb,"In the far distant past and during the post-gasolypse where men, women and grunting children fight their right to fuel, comes a man with a sorta past, a band of unshowered rebels fighting even dirtier fuelites bent on causing confusion and a paradise just beyond the sandy horizonThe Road Warrior kinda, almost continues the story of an ex-cop in a crumbling future. Before, it was about control which falls apart once supercop and absolutely mild-mannered Max loses his family to unruly bikers. Now, he's just a wanderer attempting to fuel his vehicle so he can continue to roam and eat the dog food which should go to his, um, dog.The movie begins with the worst of all stock footage scenes outside the MST3k world and explains WAR has come to this planet overgas. At any rate, Maxie Boy adapted and gets caught up in a feud from more rebels attempting to infiltrate another group of survivors and their long-term goal of a coastal getaway.And speaking of their mission: in one of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes, they state their goal is to leave the harsh, desolate and shade-less desert and go to paradise because there's plenty ofsunshine?Actually, I digress. This movie was oodles better than the first GRINDHOUSE mess of a Bmovie. It had direction, a far less domineering and better score, a minute amount of heart and character and one of the most ruthless, brutal and most importantly, honest climaxes I've seen. Meaning, people die when our heroes venture from their middle-of-nowhere sanctuary to get to the Northern-Most Paradise and you'll never guess who lives or dies. Okay, maybe one or two characters, but the rest were relentlessly slaughtered and it's a shocker. Sad, but refreshing from the goody-two-shoes normality of cinema in general.Question: When will Max ever get mad? In #1 he's fairly mild to the point of extremely calm. And yes, we know Mel can get mad, vicious, eventhough that's actually in the far distant future. Here, he might portray a semi-crazy individual for his road warrior'ing skills, but other than that use of the word ""mad,"" I still have yet to see a ""MAD"" side of this character. Perhaps further in Thunderdome? I can see where they felt the first was an iconic, albeit so-bad-its-enjoyable feature whereas a lot of the same qualities carried over. Such as: CRAZY side characters, both good and bad, a lot of desert and lone road scenes and, of course, the gayness lives on, including a whole bunch of pink. The first movie had plenty of homoerotism, and part 2 carried on that tradition. Assless chaps on a guy who's in love with (and yes, they say that) another male and they ride very close on a motorcycle together with the assless chaps touching the other chap. Also, apparently, in the future, bondage including whips, chains, masks and male-on-male control is wildly accepted.Beyond the Valley of the Semi-Gays, lives a surprisingly, yet, partially enjoyable throwback to the early eighties. If you love those movies, where they put very little thought into the script – such as, Gas = Gold in this future, but everyone finds it satisfying to waste a bunch of it while doing donuts on motorcycles – you'll probably like this. But be warned: if you're a Gibson fan, such as I STILL AM, these first two films really don't define him as an actor or person. The mere nickname the character has, MAD MAX, should indicate a loony or angry individual, of which, he's neither – even when he's beaten down.",thesar-23,March/2013,4, Warriorworld,0,"[far, distant, past, men, woman, grunt, child, fight, right, fuel, come, man, sorta, past, band, unshowered, rebel, fight, even, dirtier, fuelites, bent, cause, confusion, paradise, beyond, sandy, horizon, road, warrior, kinda, almost, continue, story, crumble, future, control, fall, apart, supercop, absolutely, max, loses, family, unruly, bikers, wanderer, attempt, fuel, vehicle, continue, roam, eat, dog, food, go, um, movie, begin, bad, stock, footage, scene, outside, world, explains, war, come, planet, gas, rate, maxie, boy, adapt, get, caught, feud, rebel, attempt, infiltrate, another, group, survivor, goal, coastal, speak, mission, one, unintentionally, hilarious, scene, state, goal, leave, harsh, desolate, desert, go, paradise, plenty, ...]","[in, far distant past, during, post-gasolypse, where, men, women, grunting, children, fight, their right, to, fuel, comes, a man, with, a sorta, past, a band, of, unshowered rebels, fighting, even dirtier fuelites, bent, on, causing, confusion and a paradise, just, beyond, the sandy horizon, the road warrior, kinda, almost continues, the story, of, an ex-cop, in, a crumbling future, before, it, was, about, control, falls, apart once supercop, absolutely mild-mannered max, loses, his family, to, unruly, bikers, now, he, is, just, a wanderer, attempting, to, fuel, his vehicle, so, he, can continue, to, roam, eat, the dog food, should go, to, his, dog.the movie, begins, with, worst, of, all stock footage scenes, outside, the mst3k world, explains, war, has come, to, this planet, gas, at, any rate, maxie boy, adapted, gets caught, up in, a feud, from, more rebels, attempting, to, infiltrate, another group, of, survivors and their, long-term goal, ...]",178.63705427210803,-18.34207102640474,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,3,1,1,4,1,3,1,0,1,2,0,5.7327935222672055,247,320,far distant past post gasolypse men women grunting children fight right fuel comes man sorta past band unshowered rebels fighting even dirtier fuelites bent causing confusion paradise beyond sandy horizon road warrior kinda almost continues story ex cop crumbling future control falls apart supercop absolutely mild mannered max loses family unruly bikers wanderer attempting fuel vehicle continue roam eat dog food um dog movie begins worst stock footage scenes outside mst3k world explains war planet gas rate maxie boy adapted gets caught feud rebels attempting infiltrate another group survivors long term goal coastal getaway speaking mission unintentionally hilarious scenes state goal leave harsh desolate shade less desert paradise plenty sunshine actually digress movie oodles better first grindhouse mess bmovie direction far less domineering better score minute amount heart character ruthless brutal importantly honest climaxes seen meaning people die heroes venture middle nowhere sanctuary northern paradise never guess lives dies okay maybe characters rest relentlessly slaughtered shocker sad refreshing goody shoes normality cinema general question max ever mad 1 fairly mild point extremely calm yes know mel mad vicious even though actually far distant future might portray semi crazy individual road warrioring skills use word mad still yet mad side character perhaps thunderdome felt first iconic albeit bad enjoyable feature whereas lot qualities carried crazy side characters good bad lot desert lone road scenes course gayness lives including whole bunch pink first movie plenty homoerotism part 2 carried tradition assless chaps guy love yes another male ride close motorcycle together assless chaps touching chap apparently future bondage including whips chains masks male male control wildly accepted beyond valley semi gays lives surprisingly yet partially enjoyable throwback early eighties love movies put little thought script – gas gold future everyone finds satisfying waste bunch donuts motorcycles – probably like warned gibson fan still first films really define actor person mere nickname character mad max indicate loony angry individual neither – even beaten,-0.02977017195767196,0.5307043650793651,0
The Son of No One (2011) - IMDb,"I simply can't agree with the other reviewers who gave this film a scathing review.I suspect a lot of the bad reviews came from people expecting a crime thriller, rather than what this film actually was - a crime drama.This was a classic slow burn police drama about a cop who is once again haunted by a past he thought he had successfully left behind him years ago.It is well acted, well scripted, well shot, well scored - almost like an indie movie, rather than a crime drama.In theory this film was supposed to be about redemption, but the failure to actually create a proper redemption narrative is exactly where it all came apart, and where I believe it slipped from being a great film to something that was worth the watch, but not a keeper.Ironically, it's only in the last moments of the film that things are ruined - and rather oddly I have to say, because everything is building towards the lead character taking that final step towards redemption by making a very public confession about his past, and the corruption within his police department, but nothing even remotely like this happens.The film simply ends with him getting on with his life, as if no heinous act of murder and corruption has just taken place, and thus allowed him to carry on with life as usual in the burbs.From a technical perspective it actually feels like they either ran out of money, or time, or they didn't know how to end this film so they just finished with an el-cheapo stock footage 'newspaper with important headline on the table in foreground' shot.In fact, the previous couple of minutes before that were a little bit problematic as well - the way Ray Liotta died was highly contrived and clichéd, and totally counter to where the film had been heading, and what it had built up to over the previous 80 minutes or so.Some of you may be thinking; 'but didn't they do the same sort of thing in 'No Country for Old Men?' - yes, but the very reason they did that was to make a point about suffering and evil in the world.

The Son of No One (2011) - IMDb,"It must have been a good deal of money to get these actors in this film. Not just because they are all famous and for the most part talented people, but because this script must have been as bad as the film. Al Pacino, Tatum, Liotta, Katie Holmes, and even Tracy Morgan (Who I felt did a good job in this small role, maybe establishing himself as a bit actor for serious films) all these people couldn't make this movie good. It was bad, just plain bad. The plot was boring and really badly put together. The twists were just dull and unfounded. The ""mystery voice"" was pathetic, it was so obvious who was calling, I can't believe they tried to make it some mystery as to who it was. The end, was so disappointingly lame. There was little to no real action in it. Yeah there were a couple people killed but it wasn't any real action. No suspense was built throughout the film even at the points were a person was shot. I cannot stress enough how bad this storyline was written. There was nothing good about it. The main character was supposed to care about these killings he committed when he was a child, but in reality he had nothing to worry about there was no evidence pointing to him having any part of it 15+ years later. If the story was brought out he could just deny his involvement and would be fine. That is a small example of how poorly written this was. A good cop thriller needs plausibility, that should go without saying. I would not recommend this. I am strongly recommending against it actually. I am very disappointed. I seldom give anything less than five stars for any film that has some watchability, but with these actors, nothing of such bad quality should involve them. They definitely don't have to worry about making the rent so why would they sign on to such crap? Who knows. Anyway, all these other reviews, the ones that say this is anywhere near good stuff, don't know good movies. No one with sense could sit through this film and afterward say to oneself ""I'm glad I watched that."". There is no payoff to watching this, unless you want to be angered and write a bad review about a movie.

The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974) - IMDb,"There are many disappointing action pictures out there – this is not one of them. The genius of the film is there is no wasted motion. The picture starts right with the plot – no introduction or character development. The characters are allowed to develop as the plot moves along.Which brings us to pacing – the pacing in this picture is excellent. It moves right along and never stops, never slows, never goes too fast. This is the strongest element of its success.Another strength is its economy of motion. Many action pictures bore us with unneeded car chase scenes, shoot-em-ups, explosions and other mayhems that are used as filler when true creativity comes up short. This film needs none of that. Only that which is necessary is shown. Only that which needs speaking is spoken. This film is deftly written and crafted with great economy and this underpins the excellent pacing. It moves right along because there is no wasted motion as there is in most other action pictures.This does not mean there is no action, there is fabulous action, but only such action as is necessary to move the plot along. There is no action simply to occupy time until the requisite 90 minutes are up.The directing is equally economical. No fancy shots, shaky cameras, or special effects – just good, straight forward directing.I doubt this picture could be made today for the above reasons. The script readers would reject it for 'lack of development'; 'not enough action'; 'no romantic interest'; and all the other brainless formulas script readers dole out. The producers would demand 'more action' and 'camera work' from the directors. And, of course, a romantic interest (in some state of undress) would have to be shoe horned in.Film students should study this picture.

The Terminator (1984) - IMDb,"The Terminator is one of those films that no matter if you've seen it or not, you've heard of it, heck you know at least one or two lines without seeing it! This is the movie that blasted then new comer's Arnold Schwartzeneggerr's career, made James Cameron a name in Hollywood, and gave new meaning to a possible dark future that gave us nightmares. I remember the first time I saw this movie, I was just 8 years old and my dad of course walks in saying to cover my eyes at every ""bad"" scene with violence or nudity, needless to say about 70% of the movie he covered my eyes. Finally I got to see it with my mom and I was in love, this wasn't just an action movie, though it is one of the best, it had a story. To think this was all based upon just a quick nightmare that James Cameron had, he didn't have much money, but he had a good script, a great crew on his side to make one of cinema's greatest movies of all time.Two men appear in Los Angeles in separate locations, manifesting in sudden, blinding flash-storms of electricity. One is heavily muscular; the other man, slim and wiry. The mysterious muscular man obtains weapons and begins hunting down all women named ""Sarah Connor"", using a phone book to track his targets. He successfully kills the first two of the three listed women. When he attempts to kill the last Sarah Connor, he is stopped by the other man, Kyle Reese who has been sent back in time to protect her. While hiding in a parking garage, Reese explains that the man hunting Sarah is actually a cyborg assassin called a ""Terminator"", built by Skynet, an artificial intelligence network created by Cyberdyne Systems. In the near future, Reese explains, Skynet gained self-awareness, initiated a global takeover of military hardware, and launched a nuclear war against humanity. Skynet ordered that a scant number of humans were to be kept alive in order to be used as slave labor. John Connor, Sarah's son, rallied the few remaining humans and led a resistance movement against the machines. After a grinding campaign, the human resistance was on the verge of victory; in a last-ditch effort, Skynet sent the Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John was born, preventing the resistance from ever being founded and allowing the machines to win by default. Reese volunteered to follow the Terminator back in time to protect Sarah; after his use of the time transportation equipment, it was to be destroyed by the resistance in order to prevent further Terminators from going back in time. The Terminator feels no pain, has no emotions, and will stop at nothing to accomplish its mission.The Terminator is personally one of my favorite movies of all time, I think because this movie really is something special. Yeah, the effects are very 80's, but for the time and even to this day, I think the special effects are much better than the CGI crud we get in today's cinema. This has everything: action, romance, horror, sci-fi, and even some dark humor. The reason why Arnold's ""I'll be back"" is so famous is not just because of his accent, but because you knew that something bad was coming. Kyle Reese's ""Come with me if you want to live"" is classic as well. If you haven't seen The Terminator, I highly recommend this movie, it's an incredible one that is sure to deliver entertainment to the fullest. This is one of the greatest movies of all time and I'm sure that you will not be disappointed, if you are, get a CAT scan.10/10",Smells_Like_Cheese4,August/2002,10, This is the movie that made a big break through for sci-fi movies!!!!,1,"[terminator, one, film, matter, see, heard, heck, know, least, one, two, line, without, see, movie, blast, new, comer, arnold, schwartzeneggerr, career, make, james, cameron, name, hollywood, give, new, meaning, possible, dark, future, give, us, nightmare, remember, first, time, saw, movie, year, old, dad, course, walk, say, cover, eye, every, bad, scene, violence, nudity, needle, say, movie, cover, eye, finally, get, see, mom, love, action, movie, though, one, best, story, think, base, upon, quick, nightmare, james, cameron, much, money, good, script, great, crew, side, make, one, cinema, great, movie, men, appear, los, angeles, separate, location, manifest, sudden, blinding, electricity, one, heavily, ...]","[the terminator, is, of, those films, that, no matter, if, you, have seen, it, not, you, have heard, of, it, heck you, know, at, least, one or two lines, without, seeing, it, is, the movie, blasted, then new comer, arnold schwartzeneggerr, career, made, james, cameron, a name, in, hollywood, gave, new meaning, to, a possible dark future, gave, us, nightmares, i remember the first time i, saw, this movie, i, was, just, 8 years, old, my dad, of, course, walks, in, saying, to, cover, my eyes, at, bad, scene, with, violence or nudity, needless, to, say, about, of, the movie he, covered, my eyes, finally i, got, to, see, it, with, my mom and i, was, in, love, was, not just, an action movie, though, it, is, of, best, it, had, a story, to, think, was, all based, upon, just, a quick nightmare, ...]",156.38740000495946,-0.5955893590678208,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,0,3,3,1,1,4,1,1,1,0,1,5,0,5.713636363636364,220,311,terminator films matter seen heard heck know least lines without seeing movie blasted new comers arnold schwartzeneggerrs career made james cameron name hollywood gave new meaning possible dark future gave us nightmares remember first time saw movie 8 years old dad course walks saying cover eyes every bad scene violence nudity needless 70 movie covered eyes finally got mom love action movie though best story think based upon quick nightmare james cameron much money good script great crew side cinemas greatest movies time men appear los angeles separate locations manifesting sudden blinding flash storms electricity heavily muscular man slim wiry mysterious muscular man obtains weapons begins hunting women named sarah connor using phone book track targets successfully kills first listed women attempts kill last sarah connor stopped man kyle reese sent time protect hiding parking garage reese explains man hunting sarah actually cyborg assassin called terminator built skynet artificial intelligence network created cyberdyne systems near future reese explains skynet gained self awareness initiated global takeover military hardware launched nuclear war humanity skynet ordered scant number humans kept alive order used slave labor john connor sarahs son rallied remaining humans led resistance movement machines grinding campaign human resistance verge victory last ditch effort skynet sent terminator time kill sarah john born preventing resistance ever founded allowing machines win default reese volunteered follow terminator time protect sarah use time transportation equipment destroyed resistance order prevent terminators going time terminator feels pain emotions stop nothing accomplish mission terminator personally favorite movies time think movie really something special yeah effects 80s time even day think special effects much better cgi crud todays cinema everything action romance horror sci fi even dark humor reason arnolds famous accent knew something bad coming kyle reeses want live classic well seen terminator highly recommend movie incredible sure deliver entertainment fullest greatest movies time sure disappointed cat scan 10 10,0.15817691742220044,0.5220702986740723,1
The Warriors (1979) - IMDb,"A gang called the 'Warriors,' exhibits qualities characteristic of classical heroes: gallantry, self-pride, loyalty, discipline, and most of all, the ability to fight...It is night in New York city... Nine leather-vested members of this small bunch, board a subway leaving their Coney Island turf and travel to Van Cortland Park in The Bronx...The 'Warriors' are only one of many in New York street gangs who have sent representatives to a unification meeting called by Cyrus (Roger Hill), the lord of the largest and most powerful gang in the city, the Gramercy Riffsa black gang all in their silk pajamas and Kung Fu shirts...Cyrus speaks to the huge gathering, explaining that all the gangs must unite, that together they outnumber the police three to one, that together they can consolidate forces and rule the city... There is wild cheering... And suddenly, out of no where, a mean, small-minded person pulls his gun and shoots to kill... The cowardly little guy of the Rogues quickly yells out that is was Cleon (Dorsey Wright), the Warriors' chief, who killed the legendary leader...In the confusion, and while the police crowds into the park and the congregated gangs flee, Cleon 'get busted' by those who think he murdered Cyrus...Without their leader, the Warriors 'got to stick together, and fight-to-survive.'

The Wild Bunch (1969) - IMDb,"There comes a point at which every man reaches the end of the road and is forced to make a decision. Fade away, or go out in a blaze of glory. It goes without saying that the main characters of this film chose the latter. Sam Peckinpah's classic western is the tale of a gang of outlaws who see the world they know slipping away all around them. Scores are getting more dangerous. Technology is making killing too easy. Still they fight on, because they simply wouldn't have it any other way.William Holden plays a man named Pike Bishop. He and his gang of outlaws hit banks, trains, you name it. They stick together no matter how thick things get. After a failed attempt at a bank robbery in which nearly an entire town is gunned down, the gang sets out to steal a shipment of new guns from the US Army and sell them to a Mexican general. But this will not be an easy score. Not only will they have to fend of US soldiers, but the railroad has hired a former member of their gang named Deke Thornton and a bunch of sloppy bounty hunters to stop them. Also, the Mexican general is a dangerous man with hundreds of men at his disposal. Pancho Villa and his army are also in the area. Bullets are going to fly, and fly they do.From the opening shot of children torturing a couple scorpions to death by feeding them to a colony of ants, this film makes its point very thoroughly about violence. In this shot we see efficient killers overwhelmed by an army of a weaker species of animal. The scorpions are a metaphor for Pike and his gang. Outnumbered at every turn, they are still a handful for those who would try to hunt them down.Pike and his men are able to pull off the score and deliver the guns to the general. But they don't go riding off happily into the sunset like the heroes of a traditional western. Their story could never end that way. Knowing that their way of life is coming to an end, and knowing that one of the gang is being tortured by the general, Pike calls the remaining members together. ""Let's go,"" he simply tells them. Each man knows what this means. They grab every gun they own and all the ammunition they can carry. Then they take a nice stroll down the main street of the general's compound to pay him and his army a little visit. The resulting gun battle has to be seen to be believed.Once the shooting stops, there is an odd; sad feeling that settles over the compound. The bounty hunters show up when the vultures do. The sight of his former companions' dead bodies slumped over the backs of horses is too much for Thornton to bear. You know he would have rather been there by their side during the battle, and now he cannot bring himself to claim the reward for their hides. He simply sits down in the dirt as the survivors of the compound quietly file out and an ominous wind begins blowing through the dusty streets. Moments later it's his turn to make a choice. You can't help but feel he made the right one.The Wild Bunch is an incredible film. If ever a film was ahead of it's time, this is it.

Thor: Ragnarok (2017) - IMDb,"I admit it, I'm not exactly a Thor fan. I think the first two Thor feature films were passable efforts but paled in comparison to other heroes outings. For this reason I went in expecting a whole lot of meh!Now Ragnarok was critically acclaimed, I never heard a bad thing about it despite the fact that I wasn't blown away by the trailer at all.So with a new Thor outing, sprinkles of Planet Hulk and more humour than usual (Especially from Thor) how'd I think it did?From the opening moments with Thor swinging from a chain awkwardly rotating as he's trying to have a conversation I was gripped. This wasn't the dull boring stoic Thor we'd grown to accept, this guy was cracking of the wise and I was laughing by buttocks off.Cate Blanchett delivers as Hela like I never expected she'd manage, Jeff Goldblum is excellent in a role he felt almost born for and the entire thing is one joke filled roller coaster ride that I enjoyed considerably more than I expected to.Did all the comedy diminish the impact of the Marvel Universe? Oddly not, it fit in perfectly even when a serious moment was underlined with a goofy slapstick laugh.Kudos to Marvel once again, so far out of every single MCU movie I've only disliked 2 and for a harsh critic like me that's really something.So much fun, so many laughs and has freshened up a character that in this guys opinion was getting a bit stale.

Thunderbirds (2004) - IMDb,"'Thunderbirds' was an immensely popular Sixties show that has transcended the years and generations to the point it is still as popular now, with both adults and children alike, as it was in its heyday. So, one would deduce the chance to produce a live-action feature film with a million pound Hollywood budget was an excellent opportunity to revive the series as has been done with 'Spider-Man' and 'The X-Men'. But a terrible storyline and bland acting obliterated this opportunity and it was soon apparent all that was destined for this film was a trip to the bargain bin of the kiddies' section.Instead of a film focusing on the five Tracey sons, their father and trusty geek Brain striving to rescue people and protect the world from villains, our hero in this drudge is a malcontent and bratty thirteen-year-old Alan Tracey, fourteen-year-old Tin-tin and ten-year-old brain-box Fermat, son of Brains (yes, Brains' son despite this being a man who could surely never score a woman if he tried; maybe he grew the kid in a petri dish). As one can tell from a run-through of our three lead characters, this 2004 remake 'Thunderbirds' was clearly aimed at entertaining only children under twelve instead of trying to appeal to a broad age-range as those involved in the much superior revival of 'Spider-Man' did. The plot itself was so bland with clunky, awkward dialogue and weak jokes that probably wouldn't amuse brighter pre-teens. The scriptwriter seemed more interested in ripping off 'Spy Kids' (which was at least quirky and original) instead of remaking the show people know and love.Although Sophia Myles and Ron Cook were excellent as Miss Penelope and Parker, they only had about three lines between them so their presence was barely felt. Bill Paxton's Jeff Tracey was just boring and there was only the slightest of mention of the other four Tracey boys while Anthony Edwards and Ben Kingsley, as Brains and the Hood respectively, were just embarrassing. The Hood, in particular, is not at all threatening or sinister and instead comes across as a campy, two-bit stereotypical villain as limp as a piece of rotting lettuce.Brady Corbet, who plays Alan Tracey, may well be a good young actor but it was hard to see that in a film where he plays a whinging brat who just grates and the same goes for Vanessa Anne Hutchinson as Tin-tin since the most she gets to do is look pretty and be all for 'Girl Power'. Ironically, it is young Soren Fulton's Fermat who is the only interesting character of the film as Fulton delivers a natural and relaxed performance.'Thunderbirds' the series will be forever remembered as an excellent show that proves puppets can give solid performances! 'Thunderbirds' the film will be forgotten by most and remembered by a few as one big flop.",cosmic_quest2,April/2006,3, Makes you want to take up Bird shooting,0,"[immensely, popular, sixty, show, transcend, year, generation, point, still, popular, adult, child, alike, heyday, one, would, deduce, chance, produce, feature, film, million, pound, hollywood, budget, excellent, opportunity, revive, series, do, terrible, storyline, bland, act, obliterate, opportunity, soon, apparent, destine, film, trip, bargain, bin, kiddy, film, focus, five, tracey, son, father, trusty, geek, brain, strive, rescue, people, protect, world, villain, hero, drudge, malcontent, bratty, alan, tracey, fermat, son, brain, yes, brain, son, despite, man, could, surely, never, score, woman, try, maybe, grow, kid, petri, dish, one, tell, three, lead, character, remake, clearly, aim, entertain, child, twelve, instead, try, appeal, broad, involve, ...]","[thunderbirds, ' was, an immensely popular sixties, show, has transcended, the years, generations, to, the point it, is, still, as, popular, now, with, both adults, children, alike, as, it, was, in, its heyday, so, one, would deduce, the chance, to, produce, a live-action feature film, with, a million pound hollywood budget, was, an excellent opportunity, to, revive, the series, has been done, with, spider-man, ', the x-men, a terrible storyline, bland acting, obliterated, this opportunity, it, was soon apparent, all that, was destined, for, this film, was, a trip, to, the bargain bin, of, the kiddies, section.instead, of, a film, focusing, on, the five tracey sons, their father and trusty geek brain, striving, to, rescue, people, protect, the world, from, villains, our hero, in, this drudge, is, a malcontent, bratty, thirteen-year-old alan, tracey, fourteen-year-old tin-tin and, ten-year-old brain-box fermat, son, of, brains, brains, son, despite, being, a man, could, surely never, score, a woman, if, he, tried, maybe, he, ...]",101.5870599953614,-13.515560867985627,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,1,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.706467661691543,201,258,thunderbirds immensely popular sixties show transcended years generations point still popular adults children alike heyday would deduce chance produce live action feature film million pound hollywood budget excellent opportunity revive series done spider man x men terrible storyline bland acting obliterated opportunity soon apparent destined film trip bargain bin kiddies section instead film focusing tracey sons father trusty geek brain striving rescue people protect world villains hero drudge malcontent bratty thirteen year old alan tracey fourteen year old tin tin ten year old brain box fermat son brains yes brains son despite man could surely never score woman tried maybe grew kid petri dish run lead characters 2004 remake thunderbirds clearly aimed entertaining children twelve instead trying appeal broad age range involved much superior revival spider man plot bland clunky awkward dialogue weak jokes probably would amuse brighter pre teens scriptwriter seemed interested ripping spy kids least quirky original instead remaking show people know love although sophia myles ron cook excellent miss penelope parker lines presence barely felt bill paxtons jeff tracey boring slightest mention tracey boys anthony edwards ben kingsley brains hood respectively embarrassing hood particular threatening sinister instead comes across campy bit stereotypical villain limp piece rotting lettuce brady corbet plays alan tracey may well good young actor hard film plays whinging brat grates goes vanessa anne hutchinson tin tin since gets look pretty girl power ironically young soren fultons fermat interesting character film fulton delivers natural relaxed performance thunderbirds series forever remembered excellent show proves puppets give solid performances thunderbirds film forgotten remembered big flop,0.09312289562289562,0.5589197530864198,1

Torque (2004) - IMDb,"A lot of people think that I love the ""Charlie's Angels"" movies because I think they're ""so bad, they're good"", when that's actually not true. On the contrary, I think they are pretty smart (especially in the precise way they constantly reference pop culture in clever and heartfelt ways). And yes, they are totally silly and unrealistic and goofy, but what I like about that is that it's completely intentional (which is what most people don't get, and is so obvious to me).""Torque"", on the other hand, is a perfect example of a movie that is TRULY so bad, it's good. Or at least enjoyable in a surreal, lunatic sort of way. This movie seriously doesn't have a brain in its head.In every sense a B-movie, it most resembles those gleefully exploitive, low-budget movies that Roger Corman and Russ Meyer made decades ago, where biker gangs did battle with their switchblade-toting girlfriends at their side. And it's every bit as silly as it sounds, which could be either good news or bad news for you, depending on what kind of filmgoer you are.
Personally, I knew it was crap the whole time, but still had a blast watching it. The story is ridiculous and the dialogue is ludicrous (these characters exist in a world where when a girl says ""Nice bike"", the guy says ""Nice a**"" and she LIKES it). But I cannot fully resist a movie in which two improbably beautiful biker chicks stare each other down on their bikes in a photogenic, deserted alleyway (both of them in front of huge product logos, for extra giggles), one of them yells ""Bring it on, b****!"", the other whips out a switchblade, and then they charge! As a classic B-movie enthusiast, I offer no apologies for having fun watching a scene like that.
It's really not all bad, either. Martin Henderson and Monet Mazur have some genuinely nice and tender scenes together, and the great, color-conscious cinematography makes everything look so shiny you could eat off the screen. Jamie Pressly is an absolute hoot as the evil biker chick, and Adam Scott scores some laughs as a conceited F.B.I. agent.Also, several of the action scenes are pretty amazing, once you get over the idea that this movie is obviously not taking place on planet Earth, but rather some video game universe or a 12 year-old's dream.
I wish Ice Cube was off doing the kinds of good movies he used to make (like ""Three Kings"", the original ""Friday"", ""Boyz N The Hood"", ""Higher Learning"", ""Ghosts Of Mars""...), but he contributes some laughs as one of the heavies here. I do wish he had changed his expression at least once, though. You know the one where he grits his teeth and curls his upper lip so that he look like he hates your guts and steam is about to come out of his ears? That's the one that he has throughout the entire movie.
Basically, I'm not gonna fight for this movie or anything, I realize it's of essentially no value.

Torque (2004) - IMDb,"There are bad movies and then there are painful movies. Then there's Torque which very well may have defined a new term of ""bad"".For those previous comments who argue that this is a B-Movie and that viewers should ""lighten up"" - you need to look up your definitions. A B movie is low budget. This was obviously not low budget. I would have to lighten up to the degree of being an overexposed photograph of the kid from Powder to even watch another minute of this film again.There is something about cult or campy flicks that is difficult to explain. On paper or at face value a campy movie can be bad but there's a sense of ""fun"" in it. You can watch Faster Pussycat Kill Kill and think that they actually had fun filming it AND screening it. You watch Torque and you think that on day 33 of the shoot it must have been painful beyond belief for the crew to answer their alarm clocks.Torque doesn't work in ANY labeling of film. It isn't low budget. It doesn't feel campy. It isn't even funny bad. Unless the real life actors are complete idiots in real life they must have been downright embarrassed by this. It paid their bills though.There is ZIP for any sort of conversation that even mildly could be construed as entertaining. The editing is a total MTV hyperkenetic ADD disaster. The stunts are neither even remotely plausible or interesting. The love interest scenario was as cliché as possible. Ice Cube couldn't act his way out of a styrofoam cup in any movie previously and it still shows.I feel that this movie was literally a physical challenge to watch. Around the midway point I felt like I had just free climbed Devil's Tower. Perhaps I lost a few years of my life from the physical exhaustion this movie delivered to my body.On the upside though - I feel like after having watched this movie I could watch any 9 hour insurance seminar without batting an eye.

Udta Punjab (2016) - IMDb,"Till date, Bollywood has mostly showcased Punjab as land of prosperity full of dancing farmers in fields and big time foodies relishing sarson DA sag & makke Di roti. Intermittently some makers did show the issue of militancy phase of 80s in films like Maachis. However, this land of green-fields has off late been trapped tight in clutches of narcotics. On such a dry topic, perhaps only some documentaries would be made/ already made. To bring this issue on silver screen with mainstream actors while balancing entertainment value and remaining uncompromising on the authenticity of subject and premises, requires a lot of research work and intelligence from director and production team. Full marks to director Abhishek Chaubey and producers Anurag Kashyap (who fought the valid legal battle with censor board) and Balaji Telefilms, for raising cinematic benchmark of film-making and bringing to notice of the nation and world, the other face of Punjab through Udta Punjab. Thanks to this movie, since its controversial phase with CBFC, there have been innumerable articles on this issue across media informing we, the people of India, about the ongoing menace in Punjab. Hope, the movie manages to wake up those in power!My analysis of various facets as below: Plot: Yes, Punjab is nose dipped in the dark world of drugs and is almost on the verge of becoming another Mexico. The movie manages to touch the right chord in terms of characterization, casting, premises and most importantly, story-line. 3 sets of stories woven around perils of drugs run in parallel only to converge before/ at climax. The movie wins as it manages to prove that drugs have gripped all classes – low/ middle/ high with equal jeopardy. While showcasing modus-operandi of this fatal trade, the film questions the irresponsible and corrupt practices of administration and politics alike. The movie is full of cuss-words which do not look out-of-place and add to the genuineness of this North-Indian region. Despite having 2 pairs, the movie is subtle yet graceful on romantic front. Cast: Shahid Kapoor has already proved his mettle in psycho- emotional roles in movies like Kaminey & Haider. As Tommy Singh, the gabru rap-star, he only raises the bar a notch higher exuding full- on madness mixed with the sensitive and remorseful side of the character. However, it is Alia Bhatt for me, who emerges as the biggest surprise, gracing the role of a Bihari migrant labourer. She literally wears the unnamed character on her sleeves, not only through diction of that perfect dialect but more through the immaculate body-language oozing terrific vulnerability, angst and strength of her character. Highway is history now; this girl will be known by Udta Punjab in future! Kareena Kapoor Khan does full justice to her comparatively shorter role as a sensible doctor while giving a glimpse of a Geet intermittently. Debutant Punjabi superstar Diljeet lives up to his name winning hearts with his sincere performance changing gears from a corrupt official to a man with a purpose. Young actor Prabhjyot Singh impresses a lot as drug- addict brother of Diljeet. Rest of the cast is as realistic as the film. Music: Generally, movies on such serious topics do not require songs. However, since this one involved a music celebrity, rap songs were inevitable while a couple of others with that touch of Punjab Di mitti are heart-warming and do not disturb the pace of the film. Amit Trivedi wins it this time too! Cinematography: The movie, as the name suggests, is based in Punjab, the real one residing in small towns and districts. Rajeev Ravi leaves no stone unturned in adding maximum realism to the canvas of the film. Flaws: Some people might find the climax a bit filmy (fictional). However, that is perhaps required to end the film on a positive note, which I definitely liked.In all, Udta Punjab is definitely going to be one of the best films of this year in terms of the production quality, content, performances and music.

Ultraviolet (2006) - IMDb,"Ultraviolet was embarrassingly terrible on so many levels. My husband and I usually really dig the comic book and action movies, so I think that our expectations were reasonable for the genre. The kinds of movies that Ultraviolet tried to channel were X-Men, The Matrix and Underworld. Unfortunately, this movie failed to do so.1) Dialogue was laughably bad. One of Milla's lines was actually ""Because these beautiful moments turn evil when they're over."" What?? This was regarding a romantic pass made at her. Totally incongruous with the setting. 2) Excessive use of CGI is a personal irritant. Additionally, the motorcycle chase scenes were only one step above TRON. I might as well have been watching my 11 year old neighbors play some video game. 3) Zero character development. I didn't care about Violet, the french guy, the scientist guy, the pretty boy, or the evil nose filter guy. I didn't care about their individual goals (mainly because they weren't very clear). I didn't care about characters dying, and I didn't care about the revelation at the end; the only indicator that I had that it was important was her somewhat awed reaction.To be fair, Milla Jovovich has an incredible face and body and is well-suited for fight scenes. If all-CGI, all-the-time is your thing, then you'll be thrilled with the loads of glossed-over fight scenes involving Milla and hordes of green screen baddies.

Universal Soldier: The Return (1999) - IMDb,"The mind boggles at exactly what about Universal Soldier merited a sequel. Since the real star, Dolph Lundgren, would not be able to reprise his role from the original, there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write-off. Bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler Bill Goldberg and martial arts expert Michael Jai White. To their credit, they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement. Bill Goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film, and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role. For once, his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times, and it does not get irritating. The problem from the audience's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes Lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films. And therein lies the problem. You do not go to see a Van Damme film because you want serious action. You go because you want comedy, however unintentional.Unbeknownst to many people, Universal Soldier was followed by two direct-to-video sequels. I have only seen the first, which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke. Matt Battaglia was so terrible in the role of Luc Deveraux that for once in his career, the sight of Jean-Claude Van Damme comes as a welcome relief. The film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct-to-video sequels, and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original. After years of investigation and explanation, the Unisol project is still going ahead, with some minor modifications. For one, the new Unisols are stronger and more damage-resistant than their earlier cousins. For another, all of the Unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called SETH. In the early parts of the film, SETH exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome.Being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes, we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut. The Unisol project is on the chopping block, which essentially means that SETH will be turned off. SETH, somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained, decides to mobilise the Unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down. His only problem is that every so often, a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown. Two individuals possess the code in question. SETH kills the first in short order, and those who are familiar with the plot kit that Van Damme's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be. The rest of the film revolves around the Unisols' attempts to get the code out of Van Damme without injuring him too badly. A subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film, but it adds about as much to the story as Van Damme does to the profession of acting.The film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichés. When SETH transplants his command module into the body of Michael Jai White, we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over. He goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity's weakness(es). Gee, SETH, you mean they will not be our strong points? All kidding aside, the short length of the film is both the film's weakness and its strength. It leaves the action without adequate setup. In the original, we are given a very thorough explanation of the Unisols, how they work, and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film. Here, the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a Unisol is and how they operate. At least in the original, a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice.

V for Vendetta (2005) - IMDb,"I am speechless. I just came back from the theatre, where I watched 'V for Vendetta'. There are three main elements in the movie and it excels on all three of them.First off the dialogues and script. Intense, witty, honest but not patronising, intelligent but not pretentious. That's the first level at which the movie surprises you. You don't except such high level of script from an action movie. But it is slowly revealed to the audience that V for Vendetta is not just an action movie. The story is filled with current events and has a definite strong political sense.Secondly Hugo Weaving's performance. It is definitely what grabs you from the start. He delivers some of the hardest lines with incredible charisma. His performance shines throughout the movie and honestly he sounds as good as any of the best actors out there. He should be nominated for an academy award.Finally the visual part. Incredible, yet no ""Matrix"" effects used. Everything looks beautiful, dark yet vibrant. The cinematography is top notch. The final battle scene brought tears to my eyes.Do not miss 'V for Vendetta'.

Vaastav: The Reality (1999) - IMDb,"The talented Mahesh Manjrekar directs his second feature which centres around the character of a simple guy whose attempts to lead a normal life fail and as a result he becomes a merciless underworld don. Manjrekar's direction is excellent and he successfully depicts the dark tone of the crime world. He offers a grim look at the underworld and not even once does he try to glorify it or show it in a positive light. On the contrary, through the main character he shows how restless those who get involved in it are. The film, though a bit unevenly executed at places, generally remains steadily focused, and the proceedings are raw and serious, without useless attempts at comedy and unnecessary subplots one gets to see so much in Hindi films. Many of the film's scenes are extremely moving.For the demanding role of Raghunath, Manjrekar casts Sanjay Dutt, one of the industry's most respected and loved stars, yet one of its most underrated actors. Dutt is simply exceptional, portraying every shade of his character with sheer conviction. He actually becomes Raghunath and manages to create a real new screen persona with his line delivery, body language and his often frighteningly serene attitude. This is one of his absolute best. Other cast members do a very good job, with Reema Lagoo delivering the most memorable performance of the lot as Raghu's tormented yet loving mother. Sanjay Narvekar is quite effective as his best friend, while Namrata Shirodkar does a fine job as Sonu, a young prostitute with whom he falls in love.Vaastav is not without its flaws. I, for one, found Raghunath's transformation far too quick to be completely believable. The film, though generally gritty, intense and matter-of-fact, gets at times a bit too emotional and consequently the level of its authenticity is thus reduced by a iota. Nonetheless, the film's final scenes are powerful and riveting and the very last scene is fantastic.

Vampire Killers (2009) - IMDb,"There is one word for this film: Weak. If you think you're going to get Shaun Of The Dead with vampires as one comment suggests you will be massively disappointed.This film is not without it's laughs, but sadly they are few and far between and mostly in the trailer (the werewolf line is still the best in the whole film so work out how much that made you laugh in the trailer, figure that's the best you're getting and decide from there).It is only 87 minutes but it still manages to get dull, something Shaun avoided. It does not have the deft lightness, charm and flow of Shaun and this is largely due to sub-Carry On writing that thinks it's funny when you are rolling eyes and groaning. The direction is lazy and feels more like one of the standard rubbish 'Brit comedian(s) comedy' like Sex Lives Of The Potato Men or Parole Officer.

Vehicle 19 (2013) - IMDb,"I watched this last week on February 23rd at the theaters. I am not sure why this was released here in Japan well before the rest of the World because Japan tends to be last in getting movies released.It was a good story overall and I must say excellent cinematography. The film takes places in Johannesburg, South Africa and the film does an excellent job showing the ins and outs of the city.Paul Walker does a great job playing Michael Woods. His role reminds me of his role in Running Scared as he seems to have a short fuse and quite foul-mouthed. Don't let the trailers of this movie fool you however. You see Paul Walker and car chases and might expect a Fast and the Furious type of flick. However this movie is more of a car adventure/drama than action/car chase movie.

Vehicle 19 (2013) - IMDb,"A low budget indie thriller with an interesting concept, but VEHICLE 19  suffers from sluggish pace and short of adrenaline rush.  The first thing that attracted me to watch this low-budget indie  thriller called VEHICLE 19 is its irresistible concept -- the movie is  shot entirely from inside the car. Now that's what I called a great  novelty. However, South African director Mukunda Michael Dewil fails to  capitalize his own concept. Instead of a fast-paced thriller normally  expected from this kind of movie, VEHICLE 19 sputters as it moves  along.  Somewhere in between, director Mukunda Michael Dewil manages to stage  some claustrophobic moments and worthy action scenes within the  confined space of a car (and limited budget). Paul Walker is fairly  adequate to put on a (mostly) one-man show as a brooding and manic  anti-hero.  It's a shame that Mukunda Michael Dewil's script is lackluster. More  than often, the movie loses its momentum whenever it tries to elaborate  the storyline. The pace is patchy, while the movie's overly-stylized  look is too distracting for its own good.

Vice (2015) - IMDb,"If you are an IMDb ""reviewer in training,"" this is a great place to start. It is sorta like a ""starter hill"" in skiing, just a nice gentle downhill slope to start your review on, and then your own momentum will take you safely to the bottom, err, end.These are my notes, to get you going * I can claim to have seen Westworld when released in a real theatre. However in a world where today's viewers have the attention span of a bumblebee, that was a long long time ago. Hollywood can remake or re-imagine it if they like. In point of fact, the core idea (seen only in the first 20 minutes, before the film seems to run out of creativity) of redoing it from the POV of the robots (oops, ""artificials"") is bloody clever and deserved much more traction than it got.* did you know Bruce Willis is 60 years old? He has been the backbone of the industry for decades (seems like just yesterday he jumped from MOONLIGHTING to DIE HARD) but he is not getting the plum roles anymore. The real bitter and ugly irony here is that Jane is doing the Willis role and not very well. If you are an alert reviewer, in every scene where Jane and Willis face off (not many) you ache to hit the pause button and imagine what the film would be like if they reversed roles.* Childers is gorgeous. But you knew that. One of the requirements to get the role is that you had to be gorgeous. And if you get trapped in a theatre on a rainy afternoon in Cleveland, there are worse ways to pass the time than to watch a gorgeous actress trying to bootstrap her career to the next level.Those are your starter notes for your review, young scribe.

Dialogues are sharp as knife and powerful as the gun shots in the movie. The BGM was rock solid which had added the feel to the play.

Vishwaroopam (2013) - IMDb,"Brilliant film-making. If you are new to Indian films, start with this or if you want to show your non-Indian friend an Indian film, select this action-thriller classic. It takes some time to suck you in but once the ride kick starts you hardly get time to think about anything else. His vision is so majestic and out of the box. Visually stunning most of the time. I would describe this as a film with technically great, with high production value, with a casting perfectly fit, with great direction - good example for great film-making.Much credit goes to Kamal Haasan.

Vishwaroopam (2013) - IMDb,"he wait is over. Kamal Hassan's biggest-ever film Viswaroopam, which has been delayed for one or the other reason, has seen the light of day in foreign countries but not in Tamil Nadu and some other Southern states as the High Court has stayed the release after several Muslim groups raised objection. After a gap of three years, Kamal Hassan is back with Viswaroopam, which is written, directed and produced by himself. The film was supposed to be directed by Selvaraghavan but as the director walked out of the film due to other commitments, Kamal took the responsibility of directing the film. The film is simultaneously made in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. It is made with the budget of Rs 95 crore, which is the second highest budget Tamil film after Rajinikanth's blockbuster Endhiran. What does the multilingual action-thriller has to offer? A reader named Praveen Kumar from New Jersey reviewed the film, as the movie was not released here. Read on for the review... The movie starts in America. Viswanath (Kamal Hassan), who will be seen as Kathak trainer, is surrounded by girls and one among them is Andrea Jeremiah. This makes Dr Nirupama (Pooja Kumar) to doubt on her hubby's character and hires a detective, who gets killed by Al-Qaeda group. The Al-Qaeda is planning to plant a Nuclear Bomb in New York and Kamal Hassan is well-aware of it. How? He has a past where he has a connection with the terrorist group, which is headed by Omar (Rahul Bose). Will the terrorist organisation succeed in their mission? What role does Kamal play? Is he a terrorist or an undercover agent? To know all these, you should watch the film. The story of the film begins on a slow note but it is gripping. The first half is entirely shot in the US, and keeps you engaged and generate a lot of curiosity.

Watchmen (2009) - IMDb,"For over 25 years now, I have cited Blade Runner as my favorite movie of all time. After seeing Watchmen, I may have to reconsider.First, I'm glad I went to see the movie alone. I've heard so many comments focused on a blue dick, or the length of the movie, or some other such nonsense, that I'm sure watching it with someone would have been a constant barrage of commentary and complaint. And no, that's not Javier Bardem. Yes, the movie is long; nearly three hours. But, unlike the dreadfully insipid Titanic, at the end of this movie I wasn't asking for those three hours of my life back. And, as with all such movies, you must be able to look beyond the literal.Watchmen is iconic and iconoclastic, deconstructionist and revisionist, laden with allegory and allusion. Consider, for example, the character Ozymandias. I'm wondering how many people who viewed the film ever even heard of Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem by the same name. The character even quotes the poem on a plinth in his Antarctic lair. The allusion is amazing. Here's the full quote;And on the pedestal these words appear -- ""My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"" Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away.'Clearly one must see the allusion to the work, in this case, of a superhero who hopes to leave mankind a lasting legacy, but realizes in the back of his mind that everything is eventually lost in time. Ozymandias was the first poem I ever examined from an expositional point of view, and I was blown away. The use of it in this movie is equally impactful.Then there is Dr. Manhattan, named, of course, for the Manhattan Project, which yielded the atomic bomb. His character is an allegory for God, and his relationship with man mirrors the apparent detachment with which God sees suffering in the world He created. The deity reference is reinforced often, and one thinks of Oppenheimer's citation of the Bhagavad-Gita, in which Vishnu takes on a godly form and says, ""Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""In an expository scene in the second act, Dr. Manhattan has a sort of recollection of his life. His account is dizzyingly elliptical, since he does not see time as linear the way others do. This scene has the lyrical feel of my favorite piece of fiction, Alan Lightman's almost unbearably beautiful Einstein's Dreams, and the reference to Einstein cannot be ignored.But the real beauty of Watchmen is the moral diversity of its superheroes. Each is flawed in different ways, allowing us to inhabit different ethical perspectives, intellectually at least, and witness their consequences. Everything from Rorshach's refusal to compromise, which makes him a doomed fugitive, to the ultimate compromise envisioned by Ozymandias, who can dispassionately evaluate scenarios where millions of lives are sacrificed, calls into question our most cherished beliefs. Where does it leave you? Well, that's for you to decide.From a purely entertainment perspective, Watchmen is stunning. The visuals are state of the art, and do not suffer from the sort of mental rejection I have for some movies that present too many special effects to swallow at once as reality. And Watchmen doesn't suffer from Hollywood's apparent fascination with camp in comic book movies. Camp works to some degree in Spiderman, since he's a somewhat humorous character to begin with. But the excess of camp rendered the Fantastic Four sequel unwatchable. Watchman proves that superheroes can use more subtle forms of humor, such as irony, without devolving into camp for cheap laughs.And the music, oh, the music. If you didn't grow up in the 60's and 70's, you will surely miss some of the impact, but don't worry. Even a second hand recollection of such iconic tunes will suffice. I am reminded of the painfully awful Across the Universe, which couldn't even pull together a decent movie built around the greatest catalog in modern music. Watchmen does it in spades.I LOL'd, I cried. The people in the theatre applauded at the end. I vowed to wait 24 hours before writing a review to see if my euphoria passed.

Watchmen (2009) - IMDb,"WATCHMEN is one of the most important texts of the 20th century. As a deconstruction of the concept of the superhero and a sharp analysis of the paranoia of the Cold War, it defines and diagnoses the period in which it was released. It also deftly demonstrates that the comic book can be a serious art form.Zack Snyder gets the majority of the key moments from the comics yet misses almost all of the themes. For one thing, everything looks too perfect, too clean, too rendered by computers. Dave Gibbons' art was deliberately grungy, fitting the dystopian alternate America of the narrative. Night Owl and Silk Spectre come together because they're lonely old heroes -- they're out of shape and struggle to regain both the fire to fight crime and the timing and physical moves they used to know -- but Snyder makes them in-shape ass kickers capable of taking out thugs in an alleyway or murderers in a prison riot. The violence in the original was brutal but also frequently just suggested but Snyder makes sure we see people get their arms cut off or their teeth break.The film is poorly cast, with only Jeffrey Dean Morgan grasping the narcissism that fuels the Comedian's desire to be a hero and his regret over his life and Jackie Earl Haley reaching the unsettled morality of Rorschach.

Like 'The Great Escape' this movie has become a staple of TV station classic war movies wheeled out once a year to keep the punters happy, and it always delivers.How can it fail?  It has spectacular scenery, great actors, lots of schoolboy WWII style action and even busty wenches in maid uniforms.  This film is ingrained in the psyche, you cannot see a mountaintop castle without thinking of Schloss Adler and the cable-car scenes.  If I'm trudging through the snow in the woods then I hear myself humming the theme from 'Where Eagles Dare'.

It's a given.I know it's not the most realistic movie ever made, but Richard Burton, Michael Horden, Clint Eastwood and the gang carry it off with great aplomb and we believe every line.  The pacing is excellent, leaving similar offerings such as 'Guns of Navarone' feeling like funeral marches.  And talk about atmosphere!  This movie reeks atmosphere, from the settings in the beautiful mountains to the scenes inside the old caste hallways to the exterior shots of people rapelling down the sides of the viciously cold walls.

Wild Wild West (1999) - IMDb,"I won't add more insults -- others here have done that well enough. This movie is godawful. But I will point out two areas that seem to be staples of bad movie remakes of beloved old TV shows. First, how about getting someone to write/direct that actually liked and understood the original? That person would understand that the West-Gordon relationship was the core. In a sense, West and Gordon complimented each other to make a slick, functional crime-fighting machine: West handled the action and romance, and Gordon took care of the thinking, deception, and humor (disguises). This was a well-used TV convention -- think the Kirk-Spock-McCoy triad in Star Trek, or the great contrasty chemistry between Bill Cosby and Robert Culp in I Spy. Add a lovable villain to the mix (not an offensive atrocity like the film-Loveless) and you've got a crazy, tongue-in-cheek action classic. The filmmakers here seemingly did not know or care about the fundamentals of the original show. Not that this is necessarily a problem, but then why bother resurrecting the premise in the first place? Why not just make Will Smith a different wild west troubleshooter? The Mission Impossible franchise has the same problem.Second, why all the emphasis on showing the principals getting to know each other? I know -- because it eats up 30% of the script, and creates conflict. But the conflict should be between West and the villain. Jim and Artie should just BE. The TV show didn't bother explaining how West met and knew Gordon, any more than Barney Miller, Mission Impossible, or 24 found it necessary to have all the main characters meet and learn to work together. They were a team with a job to do. Audiences understand this concept; having a trumped-up plot about how the heroes meet and overcome their differences is a hackneyed device that only exposes the script weaknesses present. See the film version of Dragnet (a better film, though) for another example of this unfortunate trend.Finally, a comment on the ""race"" issue. Inserting content that justifies Smith-West's skin color is no more necessary than explaining Henry V's skin color when Laurence Fishburne or Andre Braugher play him on stage. Indeed, ignoring Smith's race in a movie like this one would help us all look past such issues. If a blond actor had portrayed West, nobody would have suggested a plot that explains his Norwegian background! He just would have been West, and that would be that. But color-blind casting requires courage, and could conceivably cut into the film's bottom line. So, not in this spineless script.I seldom get mad at movies I don't like. Even The Avengers didn't anger me, though it was possibly even worse than this one. This one ticked me off REAL good.

Winchester '73 (1950) - IMDb,"Alongside Fox's ""The Gunfighter"" (1950) Universal International's WINCHESTER '73 - made the same year - is generally held to be the first of the more mature and adult type westerns that began to emerge from Hollywood in the fifties. Here was the template for the style and approach the studios would now adapt from then on when producing westerns. Produced for the studio by Aaron Rosenberg WINCHESTER '73, from a story by Stuart N.Lake, was beautifully written for the screen by Robert L.Richards and Borden Chase. Genius cinematographer William Daniels shot the picture in luminous Black & White and the masterful direction was by Anthony Mann. Although MGM's ""Devil's Doorway"" (1950) was Mann's first western WINCHESTER '73 is regarded as his masterpiece. It was also his first picture with James Stewart with whom he would have a very fruitful working relationship throughout the fifties. They made eight films together of which six were westerns including the brilliant ""Naked Spur"" (1953) and ""The Far Country"" (1955).In WINCHESTER '73 Stewart plays Lyn McAdam who arrives in Dodge City hot on the trail of one Dutch Henry Brown - the man who shot and killed his father. Taking place in the town is a sharp shooting contest which McAdam knows Brown will be present to compete in. They both enter the competition and in an exciting finale McAdam wins the top prize of a spanking new Winchester rifle - the ""one in a thousand"". Brown, the bitter runner-up snarls ""That's too much gun for a man to win just for shootin' rabbits"" Later Brown with his two cohorts (Steve Brodie and James Milican) waylay McAdam in his hotel room and steal the rifle. On his trail again the notorious gun goes from Brown to unscrupulous Indian trader (John McIntire), to an Indian chief on the warpath (Rock Hudson), to a cut-throat outlaw (Dan Duryea) and finally back to Dutch Henry who, as it turns out, is McAdam's wayward brother Matthew. The picture ends in a terrific chase sequence culminating in a well staged shootout between the two siblings in a rocky terrain ( The bullets ricocheting off the rocks in this sequence is a brilliant special effect and is quite extraordinary!). Finally McAdam kills Matthew and regains possession of the prized rifle.With an excellent cast - performances are outstanding. Stewart of course is great! That gangly ah shucks persona is as ever appealing. An engaging characterization the actor would maintain and reuse in all of his westerns along with the same sweat stained Stetson. With WINCHESTER '73 he would join the pantheon of iconic western heroes alongside Wayne, Cooper, Scott, McCrea, Fonda and Ford. Stephen McNally too is exceptional as the evil brother and Shelly Winters was never better in the female lead. But a revelation is Dan Duryea as a wild and slightly loony killer with the cracker of a name - Waco Johnnie Dean. Affecting a creepy effeminate snigger and demeanour he steals every scene he's in as the sly and giggling gunman. The supporting cast are also wonderful - character actors such as J.C. Flippen (a Mann favourite), Charles Drake as a coward, Will Geer as an aging Wyatt Earp and watch out for a young Tony Curtis as a cavalry trooper.The picture also has a terrific score but there is no composer credit. The soundtrack, supervised and directed by Universal's head of music Joseph Gerhenson, was made up of stock music from a plethora of composers including Frank Skinner, Hans Salter, Julius Styne and a host of others.WINCHESTER '73 is one of the finest westerns ever made.

Wing Commander (1999) - IMDb,"I was intrigued, after hearing many different points of views on this movie, to go see it. So I go to this used tape store, (why rent it for $5 when you can buy it for $2?) and buy it. I just wanted to see which side I agreed with. Most people that stated their opinions, said that this movie was a waste of time. Other people said it was the best movie they've ever seen, but I'm guessing they were fans of the video game or the 1977 version of this movie, both of which I've never seen. To go straight to the point and make it easy for those who don't know whether to see it or not, I'll let you decide for yourself based on my opinion. So to make it simple I'll just say the good and bad stuff about it.Bad Stuff:~Freddie Prinze Jr. sucks at acting. There's no other way to put it. I got very bored watching his one expression and monotone voice.~Right from the beginning, I thought the music was terrible. Music is supposed to drag you in from the beginning and give you a sense of what's coming, (think ""Jaws."") This just made me feel like I was about to see Captain America.~The alien make-up was so extremely ridiculous that they looked like overgrown house pets. Not scary at all. ~I got tired of hearing people state the obvious. ""Hey! I think something's wrong!"" Well, aren't you the sharp one. The exploding bombs and loud ""red alert"" beeping didn't give it away, did it?~The story had it's boring moments. There were parts I didn't follow and soon didn't even care, because I had gotten so lost by then it didn't matter.~*This may or may not be a downside* I wasn't sure if the accents in this movie were taken from the video game or original, but it was way too weird. We had a Scottish guy, a ton of Englishmen, Americans, and some Asians. How did they all get on this one ship?Good Stuff:~Matthew Lillard did a fabulous job. I'm so used to seeing him act like an a**hole, (no offense, think ""Scream."") that I wasn't expecting the serious performance he gave. It blew me away how serious he had to be in some scenes, and he pulled it off beautifully. (Although I gave the movie 5 stars, I would like to give his performance a 10.)~The plotline, although confusing, did have it's certain interesting moments. I don't know which came first, Starship Troopers or this, but I have a feeling one of them is a rip-off of the first. However, it certainly had it's moments that put you in suspense.~The special effect were great. It reminded me a lot of Star Wars. And the battle scenes were exciting.~The rest of the cast didn't do too bad a job of acting. I was able to feel sorry for most of them.I gave this movie a 5. If you have nothing better to do, I suggest you watch it. I certainly have seen worse, (read my review of ""Jeepers Creepers."") If you liked ""Starship Troopers"" this is a movie for you. However, if you want something more out of a Sci-Fi movie of this sort, I suggest ""Pitch Black."" *****/10",Oreolove30,June/2002,5, Not as bad as everyone says it is... but not as good either,0,"[intrigue, hearing, many, different, point, view, movie, go, see, go, use, tape, store, rent, buy, buy, want, see, side, agree, people, state, opinion, say, movie, waste, time, people, say, best, movie, ever, see, guess, fan, video, game, version, movie, never, see, go, straight, point, make, easy, know, whether, see, let, decide, base, opinion, make, simple, say, good, bad, stuff, stuff, prinze, suck, act, way, put, get, bore, watch, one, expression, monotone, begin, thought, music, terrible, music, suppose, drag, begin, give, sense, come, think, jaw, make, feel, like, see, captain, alien, extremely, ridiculous, look, like, overgrown, house, pet, scary, get, tire, ...]","[i, was intrigued, after, hearing many different points, of, views, on, this movie, to, go, see it, so i go, to, used, tape store, why, rent it, for, when, you, can buy, it, for, buy, it, i, just wanted, to, see, side i agreed, with, most, people, that, stated, their opinions, said, that, this movie, was, a waste, of, time, other people, said, it, was, the best movie they, have ever seen, i, am guessing, they, were, fans, of, the video game, the 1977 version, of, this movie, both of, i have never seen, to, go, straight, to, the point, make, it, easy, for, do not know whether, to, see, it, not, i, will let, you, decide, for, yourself, based, on, my opinion, so, to, make, it simple i, will just say, good and, bad stuff, about, it.bad stuff:~freddie prinze jr, sucks, at, acting, is, no other way, to, put, ...]",77.3652847144417,1.7622804905681222,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,3,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.285714285714286,175,246,intrigued hearing many different points views movie used tape store rent 5 buy 2 buy wanted side agreed people stated opinions said movie waste time people said best movie ever seen guessing fans video game 1977 version movie never seen straight point easy know whether let decide based opinion simple good bad stuff bad stuff freddie prinze jr sucks acting way put got bored watching expression monotone voice right beginning thought music terrible music supposed drag beginning give sense coming think jaws made feel like captain america alien extremely ridiculous looked like overgrown house pets scary got tired hearing people state obvious hey think somethings wrong well sharp exploding bombs loud red alert beeping give away story boring moments parts follow soon even care gotten lost matter may may downside sure accents movie taken video game original way weird scottish guy ton englishmen americans asians ship good stuff matthew lillard fabulous job used seeing act like hole offense think scream expecting serious performance gave blew away serious scenes pulled beautifully although gave movie 5 stars would like give performance 10 plotline although confusing certain interesting moments know came first starship troopers feeling rip first however certainly moments put suspense special effect great reminded lot star wars battle scenes exciting rest cast bad job acting able feel sorry gave movie 5 nothing better suggest watch certainly seen worse read review jeepers creepers liked starship troopers movie however want something sci fi movie sort suggest pitch black 10,0.0018959435626102385,0.6042585243974133,1
Wings (1927) - IMDb,"Famous of course for winning the first Oscar for best film, WINGS is also one hell of a good film. Spectacular aerial photography highlights the terrific performances of the three leads: Clara Bow, Buddy Rogers, and Richard Arlen. Director William Wellman creates a solid and moving anti-war statement as he shows us the brutality and stupidity of war, its waste of youth, and its power to destroy the lives of all involved.The film starts with star-crossed lovers in a small town in America. Bow loves Rogers but he loves Jobyna Ralston. Ralston loves Arlen and he loves her but through a mistake, Arlen thinks she loves Rogers. Then the boys go off to war. The outgoing Rogers thinks the war will be an adventure; the shy Arlen goes off, leaving his devastated parents who cannot express their emotions. Bow soon goes off to be an ambulance driver. Ralston stays homes and waits.The story follows the rivalry and growing friendship of the boys as they head for war. The story ends in yet another bitter mistake. The viewer is as emotionally drained by the end of this film as the parents were at the beginning.El Brendel provides some comedy relief. Roscoe Karns has a small part. Henry B. Walthall and Julia Swayne Gordon are the parents. And Gary Cooper has one brief scene with Rogers and Arlen. The scene in which he turns and flashes that famous smile as he exits the tent supposedly made him a star.Clara Bow is solid as the spirited home-town girl who chases Rogers to no avail. She's gorgeous here and she is even moreso in the Paris scene where the matron lets her borrow a snappy and dazzling dress. Few women in film history have been able to be so sexually charismatic as Clara Bow. She's also a good actress.Richard Arlen and Buddy Rogers give their best performances here. Each takes turns as the center of attention as they become men during the grueling war. Their flight scenes are incredibly well done. Arlen's flight scene as he races toward the American lines is amazing.Jobyna Ralston has a rare memorable film not working with Harold Lloyd. And Henry B. Walthall is quietly grand as the crippled father.Wellman's direction and the camera work of Harry Perry are beyond perfection. The aerial battles are breathtaking as are the scenes where they blow up the German blimps. There's also one astounding scene in the beginning of the film where Ralston and Arlen are in a swing. The camera is mounted in a stationary position in front of the actors so we see the scene as though we are in the swing with them. Then suddenly in the background we see Rogers in his jalopy pulling up in the street. The swing stops and Ralston gets out and runs to Rogers (in the background) while we see the close-up of Arlen as he twists in the swing seat and turns to watch them. It's an amazing scene and all one shot.This film is a must see.",drednm21,October/2007,10, A Stunning Achievement,1,"[famous, course, win, first, oscar, best, film, wing, also, one, hell, good, film, spectacular, aerial, photography, highlight, terrific, performance, three, lead, clara, bow, buddy, rogers, richard, arlen, director, william, wellman, creates, solid, move, statement, show, u, brutality, stupidity, war, waste, youth, power, destroy, life, film, start, lover, small, town, america, bow, love, rogers, love, jobyna, ralston, ralston, love, arlen, love, mistake, arlen, think, love, rogers, boy, go, war, outgo, rogers, think, war, adventure, shy, arlen, go, leave, devastate, parent, express, emotion, bow, soon, go, ambulance, driver, ralston, stay, home, story, follows, rivalry, grow, friendship, boy, head, war, story, end, yet, ...]","[famous, of, course, for, winning, the first oscar, for, best film, wings, is, also, one hell, of, a good film, spectacular aerial photography, highlights, the terrific performances, of, leads, clara bow, buddy rogers, richard, arlen, director william wellman, creates, solid, moving, anti-war statement, as, he, shows, us the brutality, stupidity, of, war, its waste, of, youth, its power, to, destroy, the lives, of, all involved.the film, starts, with, star-crossed lovers, in, a small town, in, america, bow, loves, rogers but he, loves, jobyna ralston, ralston, loves arlen, he, loves, her, through, a mistake, arlen thinks, she, loves, rogers, then, the boys, go, off to, war, the outgoing rogers, thinks, the war, will be, an adventure, shy arlen goes, off, leaving, his, devastated, parents, cannot express, their emotions, bow, soon goes off, to, be, an ambulance driver, ralston, stays, homes and waits.the story, follows, the rivalry, growing, friendship, of, the boys, as, ...]",108.47397878578265,5.2607500231132756,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,1,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.7142857142857135,189,274,famous course winning first oscar best film wings hell good film spectacular aerial photography highlights terrific performances leads clara bow buddy rogers richard arlen director william wellman creates solid moving anti war statement shows us brutality stupidity war waste youth power destroy lives involved film starts star crossed lovers small town america bow loves rogers loves jobyna ralston ralston loves arlen loves mistake arlen thinks loves rogers boys war outgoing rogers thinks war adventure shy arlen goes leaving devastated parents express emotions bow soon goes ambulance driver ralston stays homes waits story follows rivalry growing friendship boys head war story ends yet another bitter mistake viewer emotionally drained end film parents beginning el brendel provides comedy relief roscoe karns small part henry b walthall julia swayne gordon parents gary cooper brief scene rogers arlen scene turns flashes famous smile exits tent supposedly made star clara bow solid spirited home town girl chases rogers avail gorgeous even moreso paris scene matron lets borrow snappy dazzling dress women film history able sexually charismatic clara bow good actress richard arlen buddy rogers give best performances takes turns center attention become men grueling war flight scenes incredibly well done arlens flight scene races toward american lines amazing jobyna ralston rare memorable film working harold lloyd henry b walthall quietly grand crippled father wellmans direction camera work harry perry beyond perfection aerial battles breathtaking scenes blow german blimps astounding scene beginning film ralston arlen swing camera mounted stationary position front actors scene though swing suddenly background rogers jalopy pulling street swing stops ralston gets runs rogers background close arlen twists swing seat turns watch amazing scene shot film must,0.3025641025641026,0.6049145299145298,1
Wings (1927) - IMDb,"Except for Clara Bow, I did not recognize the main actors in this movie, but that is not unusual for a silent film. So when I saw Gary Cooper, I was stunned, especially when it turned out that he only had a bit part. It is hard to believe that the producer of this movie did not immediately see his star quality. As for the two principal male characters in the film, the one named Dave is obviously doomed. The sad farewell to his parents is the first clue. Then he tells his friend Jack that he thinks the next mission will be his last, and asks him to see that his parents get his medal. Finally, he forgets the teddy bear that is his good luck charm. I'd call them clichés, but for all I know, this may be the first movie in which they occurred.The only serious flaw is a scene in Paris where Jack starts seeing bubbles. It goes on way too long, almost as if the director was so excited by this gimmick that he just could not get enough. There are plenty of action sequences to make up for this, however, much of it quite graphic, including a pilot spitting up blood, and another with blood spurting from his chest, something normally not seen in movies until the 1960s.And, of course, no WWI movie would be complete without men climbing out of their trenches, charging the German lines, and being slaughtered by machine-gun fire. In one scene, a soldier who has been blinded carries another soldier who cannot walk. Together, they continue to move toward the Germans along with the others. I don't know what they thought they would do when they got there, except die, which is what they did.

X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) - IMDb,"With its mind-boggling premise and jaw-dropping cast, X-Men: Days Of Future Past blasts into cinemas bearing the weight of great expectations. Surely this mash-up of X-Men past and future has the potential to be the best superhero blockbuster our world will ever see? Well, yes and no.To be strictly objective, Days Of Future Past can occasionally come off as a little too earnest, its enormous cast of characters getting somewhat lost in the grinding of its narrative gears. But, when it works (which is most of the time), Days Of Future Past comes pretty darn close to nerdvana – this is a smart, rich film that effectively mines its source material (both the movies and Chris Claremont's classic 1981 storyline in the comic books) and its incredible cast for emotion, power and depth.Flash forward to the bleakest of futures. X-Men we have known – led by perennial frenemies Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) – are being hunted mercilessly by a horde of intelligent, death-mongering robots known as Sentinels. With little hope for survival, the desperate X-Men decide to send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to the 1970s. There, he must find the younger Charles (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) – several years estranged after the traumatic events of X-Men: First Class – and get them to change the future before it can happen.Sounds simple enough? Not really. Days Of Future Past frequently threatens to fall foul of its complicated puzzle-box of a narrative, one that involves time travel, quantum physics and a swirling mess of characters, action and motivations. There's Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), creator of the Sentinel programme, whose assassination in the past by Charles' pseudo-sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) brings about the dystopia of the future. There are prison breaks, astral projections, and several grisly mutant deaths. Truthfully, this incredibly ambitious mix of character, plot and spectacle could very easily go horribly wrong.What's so impressive about director Bryan Singer's return to the franchise is how well he weaves all the disparate threads of his narrative together. This is emphatically not the Singer who gave us mediocre misfires like Superman Returns and Jack The Giant Slayer. Rather, this is the work of the Singer who made his mark with films like X1, X2 and The Usual Suspects, all of which featured a masterful blend of wit and wisdom, character and story.In Days Of Future Past, Singer skilfully plays on the schism that opened up between Erik and Charles at the end of First Class to add welcome depths of emotion to the high stakes already in play. The deep, difficult relationship between the two men has always been the fulcrum of the series, and Singer allows it to breathe and grow. With the help of McAvoy and Fassbender (not to mention Stewart and McKellen), some of the best actors in the business, the director makes it possible to believe that resentment can give way to forgiveness, and vice versa, often in the blink of an eye. McAvoy, in particular, gives a shudderingly good performance as a man called upon to help others when he's lost his own way.With such an enormous revolving cast of characters, Singer even manages to give many – though not all – of them their hearts and souls. (Alas, Storm/Ororo, we will never know ye!) Thrust into the unlikely role of mentor to the broken, heartsore Charles, Wolverine must find a different sort of strength and ingenuity within himself. Jackman plays the role beautifully, anchoring the two timelines with charm and gravitas. Though still something of an awkward fit for her part, Lawrence, too, plays Raven's dilemma very well, as she wavers between Charles' offer of hope and Erik's often bloody single-mindedness.But Days Of Future Past doesn't just mire itself in the toss and tumble of its characters' emotional journeys. Singer throws in a few crackerjack action sequences, opening the film with a heart-stopping massacre that very effectively underscores the dire threat posed by the Sentinels of the future. Crucially, Singer also finds the time and space within the darkest shadows of his story to have a little fun, judiciously tossing quips and sight gags into the mix – particularly in a tour de force prison break sequence, in which the preternaturally speedy Pietro Maximoff (Evan Peters), better known to comic aficionados as Quicksilver, literally runs away with the entire show.Make no mistake about it, this is a behemoth of a film that won't go down well with everybody. Newbies will almost certainly find themselves lost, bewildered, and perhaps even bored. Singer's tale sprawls in so many directions that, if you're not at least marginally invested in the characters, it could prove to be a trying experience.But, for everyone else, ranging from casual fans to enthusiasts and obsessives, Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg have crafted something truly remarkable. Steeped in history and lore, both of the cinematic and comic-book variety, Days Of Future Past feels like a dark love letter to the spirit of that original band of mutants and the message of hope, tolerance and humanity that has always accompanied their attempts to find their place on Earth.Most remarkably of all, Days Of Future Past practically radiates a bravery and freshness that you'd never expect from the seventh film in a blockbuster franchise. Instead of playing it safe and sound, Days Of Future Past mashes up past, present and future, sweeping up a lot of what has been taken for granted in the X-Men cinematic universe and, well, chucking it out of the proverbial window. The ending of this film truly opens up an intriguing plethora of narrative possibilities that stretch in any and all directions. On the strength of this outing, that's something to be anticipated, rather than feared.",shawneofthedead16,May/2014,9, A stunning achievement – a blockbuster movie packed with at least as much heart

X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) - IMDb,"*Spoilers*I tried not to get myself hyped up too much with this film because when Matthew Vaughn left I was pretty bummed out. I loved First Class and the new feel that X-Men had, I was really looking forward to him carrying that on. Unfortunately, Bryan Singer took over. Even with this lowered expectation, I found myself sitting in the cinema multiple times thinking 'Ok we get it, we understand what is at risk here, please lets get on with it!'. To start with the good points.The opening - visually amazing and the film was off to a great start. Blink was my favourite of this sequence, her powers of portals were used in really creative ways and kept the action flowing well.I didn't think I would like Quicksilver at all but I found all the scenes he was in to be extremely entertaining and gave the film the comic book feeling again. You know, that feeling of just enough realism to make it believable yet enough humour to add the fun comic book side of things? He was that in spades and I found my self disappointed when he didn't join up with the X-Men for the rest of the film.The actors. It was great to such an ensemble on screen and I'd even go as far as saying the young Charles (James McAvoy) stole the show, with the young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) a close second.There were some nice little nods to most of the other X-Men films and it was good to see all the tie-ins. Also the very few humorous parts, one which comes to mind is when Wolverine walks through the metal detector and it doesn't beep. He looks back in confusion, expecting it to go off. These were great but were far to few.Now for the not so good points.Repetition. How many times do we need to hear 'We need to stop Mystique or it's the end of all mutants!?' in some form or another. You see this visually in the past with the older X-Men getting killed off. You don't need to keep telling the audience this as it's what we're seeing! Also, 'Mystique's DNA is the key', 'They can't get Mystique's DNA or else (you guessed it), it's the end of all mutants!'. This got old really quickly and unfortunately I came out of the theatre more frustrated than anything, forgetting the good parts that I liked.Hollywood seems to think scripts don't matter nearly as much anymore, thinking it can be covered up by fabulous special effects. This is not the case at all and I hope writers are allowed to be more creative instead of getting creativity and risk taking shut down by the suits sitting in their offices.Lack of action. We're watching this film for over two hours and the best action sequences you get is at the beginning! The ending sequences would have appealed to me a lot more if I hadn't been so frustrated with the script for over half the film.All and all, this is a must watch film - but I'll only be seeing it the once.

X-Men: First Class (2011) - IMDb,"There came a point, about half way through this film, when I emerged from the world of wonder on screen, took stock of my emotions in that instant, and realized that yes, by God, I am LOVING this movie.I didn't really expect to, of course -- although certainly, I hoped for it. With such an incredible cast, an able director at the helm, a story of Bryan Singer provenance and the inclusion of some of my favorite, if lesser known, X-types (Darwin! Tempest! Havok!), I was eager to see this beloved band of merry Marvel mutants redeem themselves after the massive failures of X3 and X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE.Which they do. And how!One thing that the avid comic fan must do when approaching this movie, however, is to divorce themselves utterly from almost all established four-color X-Men continuity. Oh, some bears up, but by and large this is a whole new origin story, a reboot of epic proportions, and yet it is a retcon so cleverly done, and one that offers up a such a delicious mélange of complex relationships and sensible motivation, that all of the many discrepancies inherent in having Mystique on the side of good or having Moira McTaggert a CIA agent simply do not matter. Speaking of McTaggert, Rose Byrne is both comely and convincing in the role, and almost every other actor is perfectly, one might almost say forcefully, cast. McAvoy brings a kind of laddish charm to Charles Xavier that he mixes nicely with both decency and naïveté, and Michael Fassbender's nascent Magneto is relentlessly, even heart-breakingly, compelling. Their chemistry is electric -- theirs' is one of the most multi-faceted and sincere bromances the screen has seen in a good long while.The younger cast all impress, though particular praise must go to Oscar-nominee Jennifer Lawrence as the petulant but pitiable Raven/Mystique (The Academy Awards have been good to young, hot X-chicks; let us not forget that Rogue herself, Anna Paquin, won for THE PIANO). Former child star Nicholas Hoult is also outstanding as the troubled Hank McCoy, and perhaps the most surprising kudos must go to teenage dream Lucas Till, who conveys the particular anti-social asshole-hood of the turbulent Alex Summers very convincingly indeed.The biggest letdown in the movie, acting-wise, is January Jones as Emma Frost. True, she is appropriately ravishing, there can be no denying that, but she lacks the the zing of the written character. There is very little intelligence, snark, or even personality behind her interpretation of this most intriguing of mutants; she's just kind of Stand There and Look Pretty -- which, for one playing Emma Frost, is something a travesty.The only other weight under which this movie really labors is the fact that it is a prequel, and it therefore suffers from the feeling of inevitability that besets all such endeavors. Anakin Skywalker HAS to go Dark Side. Bilbo Baggins HAS to find the One Ring. And Magneto HAS to turn against humans; Mystique HAS to join him; Xavier HAS to end up in a wheelchair. With these definite plot developments looming, their eventuation is bound to be a bit of an anti-climax.And yet the fun part about X-MEN: FIRST CLASS is the journey it takes us on to get us there. Offering up plenty of surprises, some kickass action sequences, mighty fine special effects, sly humor and a killer cameo, it is without doubt the best comic book movie of the year – nay, decade – thus far. And considering how overcrowded that list is, this is really saying Something.Huh.

X-Men: First Class (2011) - IMDb,"Rarely have I seen a film professing to be good that ended up being as bad as XMFC. The back story altogether was silly and not just written to be taking place in the 60s, but seemed to be written as if the writers were living in the 60s. There was soooo much cheesy and corny crap. The yacht that turns into a submarine, the overly trusting CIA that takes super-powered people and lets them run wild recruiting kids to be super-secret agents for the government (what is this, Spy Kids?), the bad guy with the secret passageways behind the bookshelf and the table that spins around when you touch the secret panel...I mean all of that late 60s/early 70s James Bond flotsam that no one ever really did or had, but was all part of the ""isn't this cool, daddio"" culture of the time and so popped up in every action movie. I was waiting for there to be a mad scientist with a death-ray on the moon. So much for Vaughn's determination to bring these characters into a realistic setting. Then, the most interesting characters were the ones most under-utilized. Havok, Banshee, Darwin, Azazel and Riptide were completely glossed over in favor of the already over-exposed characters. People complain about the X-films over using Wolverine and that they are tired of it? Well, absent him, who are the two characters most heavily utilized in the X-films? Magneto (the ever-villain, whose constant inclusion negates the use of far more interesting villains) and Xavier. The other two character focal points, Mystique and Beast, have also been done. So anyone hoping for some good character exposition on the new blood...sorry, you are S.O.L. Nothing here but the same old, same old. But then, on the topic of the characters who actually did get exposition... --Magneto. You get his initial entrance into the concentration camp, and then he is 30. 12 to 30...just like that. What happened in between? What happened between when he got liberated and the first scene with him in the hotel room spinning the coin round his fingers? It was bad story telling. They wanted him to be completely unencumbered with a job, friends, a home...anything that would ground his character in reality. They wanted him to be a clean slate of a character with one thing only: revenge on Shaw. Talk about a one-dimensional character. Plus, his turn-coat to being a bad guy was practically instantaneous. Yeah, he and Xavier had that very brief convo about mutants/humans sitting across the chess board, but that was really it. Then, a few meglo-maniacal words from Shaw in the reactor room and Magneto is ready to turn coat on the only people in his entire life that he has ever been able to call friend. Almost as silly as Darth Vader's turn in Episode III. --Mystique...same exact problem. Her brother, best friend, only person in the world she really cares about. Not only does she betray his dream, not only does she go against every other one of her friends, but she up and leaves Xavier shot and possibly dying. I'd be one thing if she were a stalwart ""mutant and proud"" booster from the start, but she has only ever wanted to be normal and has known love, friendship and acceptance and she immediately turns away from her entire life and the beliefs she has had her whole life after a few kind words from a guy she threw herself at (who ultimately rejected her advances, btw). Her turn was sillier than Magneto's. At least he had the bad childhood to fall back on. --Shaw. His motivation was wholly unbelievable. He was a completely one-dimensional villain. Why exactly did he want to do what he was planning? Here he is, a wealthy and powerful man who has never known anti-mutant prejudice due to his ability to pass for a human, as well as the fact that there was no anti-mutant prejudice at this time since mutants were an, as yet, undiscovered species. And yet, he is looking to destroy all of humanity. Oh yeah, and exactly how were the mutants to survive the nuclear holocaust? I don't recall anyone claiming all mutants were immune to radiation poisoning. So he was just a cartoonish Bond villain with no reasoning behind his motivation. So characters were bad, style and execution of the plot was bad, action and FX were Michael Bay-esque in that it was random explosions and jump cuts that had too many things happening too fast to make an impact. Clichéd training montages. Terrible effects on Beast. Silly one-dimensional human characters. Some of the acting was passable, but some was flat out bad (January Jones, the Kravitz girl) and the ones that were good were really just OK. No stand out performances. And even if Fassbender and Macavoy could be seen as great, they weren't so good that the entire movie can hang on their performances. Frankly, I think this film is a beneficiary of its own hype. Maybe a lot of critics who grew up in the 60s/70s were swept up in the nostalgia for their lost childhood and looked fondly on this film because of it. High critical praise and constant...never...ending...PROMOTION for weeks had people hypnotized into thinking this movie's release was going to be the event of all events. I think it got to a point where the people who were moderately excited about its release started hyping themselves up more and more at every positive review and every new trailer. Every new viral character spotlight and every crossover (come on...a Statefarm Insurance crossover?!?). Eventually, they just told themselves that this was the movie of the year and, for those people, it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. I'd recommend passing on this one. Hopefully, they will reboot the whole series and make an X-Men movie that does the characters justice.",timbob827,June/2011,1, Truly terrible film benefiting from its own hype,0,"[rarely, see, film,

Yoga Hosers (2016) - IMDb,"Now when I first saw the trailer to Kevin Smith's (Clerks, Dogma) Yoga Hosers I was a little surprised. Now for those who have not seen the trailer for this film, and are asking yourself ""What the Hell are some Yoga Hosers?"" The trailer focuses on the two Canadian girls from Smith's last film, Tusk. Who work at a convenience store, and encounter Nazi sausages. Seriously. When I saw the trailer, my immediate instinct reaction was ""What the f*ck?"" It wasn't that what the f*ck with anger, it wasn't what the f*ck with confusion, it really was just a simple what the f*ck. Now I love Kevin Smith films. He always seemed like a cool person, he is well spoken, writes scripts with compelling characters and story, and he seems like the kind of guy you could easily talk with. His last film Tusk, in my opinion was his worst film. The films plot was there and it sounded great. What I personally didn't enjoy was the pace of the film and the characters. At least that film had a story wrapped around in it. Most people, including myself love the art form of filmmaking and movies for two main reasons. That being a story the audience can connect to and characters and audience can connect to. In my opinion, Yoga Hosers has very little story, with characters an audience cannot connect to, it isn't that funny, it's annoying, and I personally didn't get it.I do not know if Kevin Smith made this film to mess with critics, the media, and fans. Or is he just this bad of a filmmaker now? Sadly, out there in the world there really is an individual who has a film script. A film script with story, compelling characters, a story that is a breath of fresh air, and a script that is really written with heart. Unfortunately, we may never have a chance to see it, because Kevin Smith had to bring us f*cking Yoga Hosers. Sorry Ah-Boot ThatI don't know where to start with this film. For God's sake, there is even a Marvel cameo of Stan Lee in this! I didn't go into this movie thinking it was terrible. I saw it on Netflix, went in with a clear unbiased mind, and 80 minutes later I'm shocked. The one good part of this movie is Harley Quinn Smith and Lily-Rose Depp. Those two actually to capture the spirit of Clerks in a way. I found them to be a little funny. But the rest of it is just bad acting and really bad Canadian jokes. They run the same joke into the ground over and over and over and over again. I didn't know it was possible to offend and be prejudice towards Canadians. After seeing this movie, well Goddamn it is possible if you're Kevin Smith. We f*cking get it, Canadians say EH (A) ever so often. When they say about, sometimes it sounds like they are saying Ah- boot. At first it is a chuckle. After that, it is just sad; the whole movie is Eh and Ah-boot! That damn title card pops up every ten minutes when they introduce a character is bad! It looks like a want to be Scott Pilgrim and Suicide Squad.The cast is talented, but the story and they way it's written is completely ridiculous. Pucky Charms cereal ever ten minutes in your face, terrible Canadian slang jokes, looks like a 1990s video game in 2016, and this is the director of Clerks, Dogma, and Chasing Amy. There is no way in Hell this movie was made seriously, it is clearly a joke. A joke I personally do not find funny.This film is worse than Tusk. If you enjoyed it, I am more than glad you did. Maybe I just don't get the joke. Kevin Smith's down dude since day one is in this, Mr. Jason Mewes! And even he is in this for two minutes, with the look on his face like yeah I don't need this right now. Really it is a shame, it's a mess, and I will always like and respect Kevin Smith. But recently his work, his legacy, his films have gone so far down the sh*tter I don't think he can cleanly come back up. Sorry Ah-boot that, yeah you should be sorry for this sh*t you call a movie!I believe this ""movie"" earns a2 out of 10.Worst Kevin Smith film.",NileFortnerBoogieBuddha9545,December/2016,2, In All Seriousness What Happened to Kevin Smith?,0,"[first, saw, trailer, kevin, smith, clerk, dogma, yoga, hosers, little, surprised, see, trailer, film, ask, hell, yoga, hosers, trailer, focus, two, canadian, girl, smith, last, film, tusk, work, convenience, store, encounter, nazi, sausage, seriously, saw, trailer, immediate, instinct, reaction, anger, confusion, really, simple, love, kevin, smith, film, always, seem, like, cool, person, well, spoken, writes, script, compelling, character, story, seems, like, kind, guy, could, easily, talk, last, film, tusk, opinion, bad, film, film, plot, sound, great, personally, enjoy, pace, film, character, least, film, story, wrap, around, people, include, love, art, form, filmmaking, movie, two, main, reason, story, audience, connect, character, ...]","[now when, i first, saw, the trailer, to, kevin, smith, clerks, dogma, yoga hosers, i was, little surprised, now, for, have not seen, the trailer, for, this film, are asking, yourself, the hell, are, some yoga hosers, the trailer, focuses, on, the two canadian girls, from, smith, last film, tusk, work, at, a convenience store, encounter nazi sausages, seriously, when, i, saw, the trailer, my immediate instinct reaction, was, the f*ck, it, was, not, that, the f*ck, with, anger, it, was, not, the f*ck, with, confusion, it, really was, just, simple, the f*ck, now i love kevin smith films, he, always seemed, like, a cool person, he, is well spoken, writes, scripts, with, compelling characters, story, he, seems, like, the kind, of, guy you, could easily talk, with, his last film tusk, in, my opinion, was, his worst film, the films, plot was, it, sounded, great, i, personally did not enjoy was, the pace, of, the film, the characters, at, least, that, ...]",190.70367670026573,38.373349173557884,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,3,1,1,4,1,3,1,0,1,2,0,5.2378640776699035,206,361,first saw trailer kevin smiths clerks dogma yoga hosers little surprised seen trailer film asking hell yoga hosers trailer focuses canadian girls smiths last film tusk work convenience store encounter nazi sausages seriously saw trailer immediate instinct reaction f ck f ck anger f ck confusion really simple f ck love kevin smith films always seemed like cool person well spoken writes scripts compelling characters story seems like kind guy could easily talk last film tusk opinion worst film films plot sounded great personally enjoy pace film characters least film story wrapped around people including love art form filmmaking movies main reasons story audience connect characters audience connect opinion yoga hosers little story characters audience connect funny annoying personally know kevin smith made film mess critics media fans bad filmmaker sadly world really individual film script film script story compelling characters story breath fresh air script really written heart unfortunately may never chance kevin smith bring us f cking yoga hosers sorry ah boot thati know start film gods sake even marvel cameo stan lee movie thinking terrible saw netflix went clear unbiased mind 80 minutes later shocked good part movie harley quinn smith lily rose depp actually capture spirit clerks way found little funny rest bad acting really bad canadian jokes run joke ground know possible offend prejudice towards canadians seeing movie well goddamn possible kevin smith f cking canadians eh ever often sometimes sounds like saying ah boot first chuckle sad whole movie eh ah boot damn title card pops every ten minutes introduce character bad looks like want scott pilgrim suicide squad cast talented story way written completely ridiculous pucky charms cereal ever ten minutes face terrible canadian slang jokes looks like 1990s video game 2016 director clerks dogma chasing amy way hell movie made seriously clearly joke joke personally funny film worse tusk enjoyed glad maybe joke kevin smiths dude since day jason mewes even minutes look face like yeah need right really shame mess always like respect kevin smith recently work legacy films gone far sh tter think cleanly sorry ah boot yeah sorry sh call movie believe movie earns 2 10 worst kevin smith film,-0.06512249827467217,0.6044858523119394,0
Yojimbo (1961) - IMDb,"Only a handful of directors know atmosphere the way Akira Kurosawa does, only a handful. Yojinbo opens with a tracking shot of a ronin samurai walking down a dusty road. The camera wisely stays behind the samurai, played by Toshiro Mifune, so we cannot see his face or expressions. This samurai is desperate. Mifune has no master and no money. Kurosawa doesn't let you see his desperation, instead focusing on the back of his head and his profile to set up one of the most memorable characters in cinema history. The film has been copied many times, its practically the most influential film of the modern action genre. Yojinbo isn't action packed however, Kurosawa takes his time setting up characters and plot. The fact that this masterless samurai has deep compassion for strangers is different than most modern action movies alone. Toshiro Mifune is magical in the lead role. His presence is felt all throughout the film even when he isn't on camera.

Yojimbo (1961) - IMDb,"""Yojimbo"", Japanese for ""bodyguard"" is the story of Sanjuro Kuwabatake, (Mifune) a samurai without a master or anyone to protect who walks into a small Japanese village that is rife with violence caused by two feuding groups. The boss of each group tries to hire Sanjuro, who decides to solve the village's issues by pitting one side against another. Problems arise for Sanjuro when the son of one of the bosses shows up, who brandishes a gun and absolutely is not afraid to use it.""Yojimbo"" was later remade into ""A Fist Full of Dollars"", featuring Clint Eastwood, and the similarities are certainly prevalent, particularly with their respective ""heroes"". Mifune, a great actor who is able to be extremely expressive without the benefit of a lot of dialogue, is once again excellent in this film. The story itself is a good one, and the film was entertaining overall. I fear, however, that I may have either tried to watch too much Kurosawa in a short period of time, or that I may have seen his three best too early, because there wasn't a lot that excited me in this film as opposed to say, ""The Seven Samurai"", ""Rashomon"" or ""High and Low"". At times the film seemed to drag a little, and Unosuke, the guy with the gun, became kind of a joke because after awhile the way he was acting menacing with his gun was really pretty humorous. I kept thinking about the Simpsons episode when Homer joins the NRA and was using his gun for everything, including turning on the television, and I don't think that was the reaction that Kurosawa intended.I'm not panning the film as a whole; I just think that ""Yojimbo"" is perhaps not one of Kurosawa's great films. Every great director has some films that don't seem to be in the same league as their masterpieces, (though I have yet to watch a Kubrick film that hasn't left me breathless with admiration) and I'm certain that Kurosawa is no exception. Because the film was decent, but not great, I'm giving it a decent, but not great rating  an average 5/10.--Shelly",FilmOtaku7,July/2005,5, Average Akira,0,"[yojimbo, japanese, bodyguard, story, sanjuro, kuwabatake, mifune, samurai, without, master, anyone, protect, walk, small, japanese, village, rife, violence, cause, two, feud, group, bos, group, try, hire, sanjuro, decides, solve, village, issue, pit, one, side, another, problem, arise, sanjuro, son, one, boss, show, brandish, gun, absolutely, afraid, use, yojimbo, later, remade, fist, full, dollar, feature, clint, eastwood, similarity, certainly, prevalent, particularly, respective, hero, mifune, great, actor, able, extremely, expressive, without, benefit, lot, dialogue, excellent, film, story, good, one, film, entertain, overall, fear, however, may, either, try, watch, much, kurosawa, short, period, time, may, see, three, best, early, lot, excite, film, oppose, ...]","[yojimbo, japanese, for, bodyguard, is, the story, of, sanjuro kuwabatake, mifune, without, a master, anyone, to, protect, walks, into, a small japanese village, is, rife, with, violence, caused, by, feuding, groups, the boss, of, each group, tries, to, hire, sanjuro, decides, to, solve, the village, issues, by, pitting, one side, against, problems, arise, for, sanjuro, when, the son, of, of, the bosses, shows, up, brandishes, a gun, absolutely is, not afraid, to, use, it.""yojimbo, was later remade, into, a fist full, of, dollars, featuring, clint eastwood, the similarities, are, certainly prevalent, particularly, with, their, respective, heroes, mifune, a great actor, is, able, to, be, extremely expressive, without, the benefit, of, a lot, of, dialogue, is, once again excellent, in, this film, the story itself, is, good, the film, was entertaining, overall, i fear, however, that, ...]",-4.805388008967851,-3.892722997640828,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,5.814814814814816,135,174,yojimbo japanese bodyguard story sanjuro kuwabatake mifune samurai without master anyone protect walks small japanese village rife violence caused feuding groups boss group tries hire sanjuro decides solve villages issues pitting side another problems arise sanjuro son bosses shows brandishes gun absolutely afraid use yojimbo later remade fist full dollars featuring clint eastwood similarities certainly prevalent particularly respective heroes mifune great actor able extremely expressive without benefit lot dialogue excellent film story good film entertaining overall fear however may either tried watch much kurosawa short period time may seen best early lot excited film opposed samurai rashomon high low times film seemed drag little unosuke guy gun became kind joke awhile way acting menacing gun really pretty humorous kept thinking simpsons episode homer joins nra using gun everything including turning television think reaction kurosawa intended panning film whole think yojimbo perhaps kurosawas great films every great director films seem league masterpieces though yet watch kubrick film left breathless admiration certain kurosawa exception film decent great giving decent great rating  average 5 10 shelly,0.24023511904761907,0.5115505952380953,1

This is the first time I am left scratching my head wondering what exact movie did you people watch to give it such low reviews??!! This movie is what it is and a very good job of it. It is a movie that makes fun of super hero movies. Take a bitter misfit ex-superhero who can't be any less interested in training new recruits and make it funny. Zoom has his reasons to be bitter and they are CLEARLY explained, if people don't get the plot, they weren't really paying attention. The acting in this movie is very good by a well collected cast. Allen and Chase deliver slapstick one liners throughout the whole movie that are truly reminiscent of their comedic classic styles. If the one liner isn't enough to make you laugh, add the highly adorable factor from Ryan Newman as Cindy Collins is tops. The rest of the cast works very well together and even though there is a lot of predictability in the movie, it is still very funny and worth the watch. This is not a literary classic brought to life, so don't expect it to be. The negative comments about Allen are unjust, as his character wasn't' that far off from his style in the Santa Clause movies. This movie was enjoyable and I laughed out loud many times and I don't do that often with movies because they just aren't as funny in the same style.

xXx: State of the Union (2005) - IMDb,"From the creators of ""Die Another Day""! XXX: The Next Level as released on the Philippines.Having said that, it wouldn't be a surprise that this movie was just one action scene after another. Although a lot of negative feedbacks are here about the plot and the characters this movie is sure to satisfy the typical action movie fanatic. True to the reputation of that aforementioned James Bond movie there never was a dull moment in the movie. The pace and the tension of this movie just keeps the story flowing with slight stops to help you catch your breath and ingest the movie if aren't trashing it already.I admit that upon seeing Ice Cube as the one to play the role of the new Triple X I was skeptical about his capabilities. Having the typical role of a bad-ass, the attitude and situations really suit him. I wasn't totally disappointed. However, it was sort of a plot hole for them to consider Xander Cage as being less of a character than Darius Stone. I actually didn't like that idea. I'm still confused whether their mention of the previous Triple X being killed as a cover up or a fact. Hey, this is a gov't agency! One can never assume.As usual for most action movies this is another marketing scheme for brand products from Ice Cube's backpack to his gadgets and, of course, the hot cars, which I admit are the top of the line.If you're just another movie fanatic after a good rush this movie is for you - bang for your buck.

xXx: State of the Union (2005) - IMDb,"A film that should be retitled xXx2: Don't Say We Didn't Warn You.Opening with an impressive first 7-8 minutes, this film moves into cookie cutter territory at a frightening speed and continues to derail any opportunity for the audience to engage in the ridiculous plot or heavily computer generated action sequences.Ice Cube will never be thanking the academy (he at times look like he would struggle to play himself), but the Razzie committee should be on the lookout for this up and comer, this type of dribble is the cinematic equivalent of being run over repeatedly by a truck with the stereo cranked up to 11.The first xXx was at least assure of itself, popcorn action with the acknowledgment that it was bang for buck and nothing more. State of The Union takes itself far too seriously with a plot so absurd you swear it was written by a focus group of 13 year old boys after a binge at McDonalds. Action sequences are spaced every ten minutes or so as bookends to move Cube onto the next dilemma, each new sequence becoming further and further detached from reality (the final twenty minutes is utter insanity that makes films like Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle seem like documentaries). A sequence involving a train should be parody material, not a serious plot device.Samuel L Jackson cashes in his paycheck and plods through the movie looking as though he just read the script and realized what he has got himself involved in. Scott Speedman's looks too immature to play a senior NSA agent and is largely in the film so the white folks don't feel left out. Willem Dafoe typecasts himself as the overacting bad guy yet again and X-Zibit pops in so he can possible audition for the lead in the next sequel xXx3: Turkey Season.Women are treated as fodder to either slap around or grind up against (sometimes at the same time) all to a soundtrack of nameless rappers inserted at appropriate moments so that the white kids can know what its like to be African American.My only positive comment on this whole debacle are the cars used in the film, not being a car enthusiast even I had to be quietly impressed by the rides in this film. Also this film is under the 2 hour mark a sign of a film that does know when its wearing out its welcome.Hopefully with the resoundingly negative response xXx2 has currently received another sequel looks unlikely, as films like this are about as satisfying as a having your nose broken.",pkeevers30,April/2005,2, xXx2: Coma State,0,"[film, retitled, say, warn, impressive, first, minute, film, move, cookie, cutter, territory, frighten, speed, continues, derail, opportunity, audience, engage, ridiculous, plot, heavily, computer, generate, action, cube, never, thank, academy, time, look, like, would, struggle, play, razzie, committee, lookout, comer, type, dribble, cinematic, equivalent, run, repeatedly, truck, stereo, cranked, first, xxx, least, assure, popcorn, action, acknowledgment, bang, buck, nothing, state, union, take, far, seriously, plot, absurd, swear, write, focus, group, year, old, boy, binge, mcdonalds, action, sequence, space, every, ten, minute, bookend, move, cube, onto, next, dilemma, new, sequence, become, detach, reality, final, twenty, minute, utter, insanity, make, film, like, charlie, ...]","[a film, that should be retitled, do not say, we, did not warn, with, impressive first, 7-8 minutes, this film moves, into, cookie cutter territory, at, a frightening speed, continues, to, derail, any opportunity, for, the audience, to, engage, in, the ridiculous plot, heavily computer, generated, action sequences.ice cube, will never be thanking, the academy, he, at, times, look, like, he, would struggle, to, play, himself, the razzie committee, should be, on, the lookout, for, this up, comer, this type, of, dribble, is, the cinematic equivalent, of being run, over, repeatedly, by, a truck, with, the stereo, cranked, up to, 11.the, first xxx, was at, least, assure, of, itself, popcorn action, with, the acknowledgment, that, it, was bang, for, buck and nothing, more, state, of, the union, takes, itself, far too seriously, with, a plot, so absurd you, swear, it, was written, by, a focus group, of, year, old boys, after, a binge, at, mcdonalds, action sequences, are spaced, every ten minutes, so, ...]",70.14021407676098,-22.006870205684166,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,3,3,1,0,4,3,1,4,0,5,5,4,5.816753926701571,191,227,film retitled xxx2 warn opening impressive first 7 8 minutes film moves cookie cutter territory frightening speed continues derail opportunity audience engage ridiculous plot heavily computer generated action sequences ice cube never thanking academy times look like would struggle play razzie committee lookout comer type dribble cinematic equivalent run repeatedly truck stereo cranked 11 first xxx least assure popcorn action acknowledgment bang buck nothing state union takes far seriously plot absurd swear written focus group 13 year old boys binge mcdonalds action sequences spaced every ten minutes bookends move cube onto next dilemma new sequence becoming detached reality final twenty minutes utter insanity makes films like charlies angels full throttle seem like documentaries sequence involving train parody material serious plot device samuel l jackson cashes paycheck plods movie looking though read script realized got involved scott speedmans looks immature play senior nsa agent largely film white folks feel left willem dafoe typecasts overacting bad guy yet x zibit pops possible audition lead next sequel xxx3 turkey season women treated fodder either slap around grind sometimes time soundtrack nameless rappers inserted appropriate moments white kids know like african american positive comment whole debacle cars used film car enthusiast even quietly impressed rides film film 2 hour mark sign film know wearing welcome hopefully resoundingly negative response xxx2 currently received another sequel looks unlikely films like satisfying nose broken,0.03437028088190879,0.4998892580287927,1
Ölümlü Dünya (2018) - IMDb,"If you live and breathe sarcasm, this is your movie. Olumlu Dunya - ""Mortal Life"" is a movie about unusual characters gathered in somewhat unusual family that runs an ordinary Turkish diner, which sets the stage for a perfect situation-comedy.Director and co-writer Ali Atay is know as Turkish Pioneer in comedy, he continues to deliver what he is known for while setting new horiozons for Turkish Cinema. He and his team write funny and irreverent dialogues and have a very in-your-face directing style that fits right in with the tone of the movie. The pace of the movie is constantly in overdrive, meaning that the viewer is always engaged.If you take the wit and color, and combine it with the excessive violence and healty dose of sarcasm you end up with Mortal Life. I felt like watching a Tarantino-Alaturca. That's pretty high praise, and this is what the movie deserves.When the credits roll, you haven't learned very much about the world or yourself, but you had a good time. Mortal Life is a light but out of ordinary movie, and a fun one without trying.
